# Making Scale Explicit {#sec-toolkit-scale-chapter .unnumbered}

#### *Estimating Target Population Without Pretending to Know the Market*


Profit reasoning requires demand, cost, and scale to be expressed at the same level.

Demand is usually learned from a **sample**.  
Costs—especially fixed costs—are often incurred to serve a **population**.

Scale is the bridge between the two.

This toolkit exists to help you make that bridge explicit.

It does *not* ask you to predict growth.  
It does *not* ask you to estimate market share.  
It does *not* assume you are building a large company.

Instead, it helps you answer a narrower but unavoidable question:

> *What scale of demand is this design being asked to support—and is that scale plausible given what we know?*

Sometimes the answer is:

- a small, self-sustaining venture,  
- a staged path toward larger commitments, or  
- a design that only works at scale.

All three are valid outcomes.

What matters is that scale assumptions are *visible, deliberate, and testable*—not implicit.


::: {.callout-note title="How this toolkit fits" icon=false collapse=true}
This toolkit supports the transition from cost to [profit reasoning](ch11_profit.qmd).

It helps you align:

- demand learned from a sample,
- cost commitments implied by your design,
- and the population those commitments are meant to serve.

Its output feeds directly into profit reasoning and into the [Profit Analytics app](https://rconnect.byu.edu/ProfitAnalytics).

## Step 1: Identify the Unit Mismatch

Begin with a simple diagnostic.

> *At what unit was demand learned—and at what unit are costs incurred?*

Examples:

- Demand learned from 80 survey respondents; costs assume a regional operation.
- Demand learned from early adopters; costs assume a staffed organization.
- Demand and costs both expressed per unit (no mismatch).

If demand and cost are already aligned, no scaling is required.

If they are not, scaling is unavoidable.

This step prevents a common error: *asking a small sample of customers to carry population-level commitments.*





## Step 2: Define the Service Population (Not the Market)

Instead of asking *“How big is the market?”*, ask:

> *Who could this design realistically serve, given how it is built and accessed?*

The service population is defined by constraints, not aspirations.

Consider:

- geography,
- distribution channels,
- regulatory or eligibility limits,
- organizational capacity,
- awareness and discoverability.

This population may be:

- small and local,
- professional and niche,
- or broad but hard to reach.

If a constraint does not apply, leave it blank—and say why.

Blank means *not triggered*, not *forgotten*.

The easiest way to make these constraints explicit is to write them down.

The table below shows what this looks like in practice.

#### Demonstration of Defining the Service Population (Scaling Demand Up)

This table is used when demand is learned from a **sample**, but costs bind at a **population level**.

Its purpose is not to size a market, but to make population constraints explicit.

| Population Layer | Constraint Applied | Estimated Count | Confidence | Notes / Rationale |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Total people who exist | Geographic boundary | 75,000 | High | Residents of Springville, UT |
| People reachable | Distribution / access | 12,000 | Medium | Only those near retail locations |
| People eligible | Regulatory / eligibility | 12,000 | High | No additional constraints |
| People likely to encounter the offer | Awareness / discoverability | 4,000 | Low | Depends on marketing effectiveness |
| **Service population** | **All constraints combined** | **4,000** | **Low–Medium** | Population this design could plausibly serve |

**Interpretation:**  
This population is not a prediction of adoption.  
It is the population to which demand may be *scaled* when evaluating fixed commitments.






## Step 3: Separate Population from Adoption

Population answers *who could buy*.  
Adoption answers *who chooses to buy*.

Do *not* estimate adoption directly.

Adoption emerges later from:

- price,
- demand shape,
- and competition.

At this stage, your task is only to define the population that demand will eventually be scaled to—*if the design is pursued*.

This keeps scale assumptions disciplined and avoids market-share guessing.







## Step 4: Align Demand to the Cost Commitments Being Evaluated

Once demand and cost are expressed at different levels, they must be aligned.

In practice, this almost always means *scaling demand to the level implied by the cost commitments you are evaluating*.

That is the default move.

Fixed costs—whether large or small—are not artifacts to be allocated.  
They are commitments that define the scale at which the venture must work.

The task, therefore, is not to “choose a scaling trick,” but to be clear about *which commitments are under consideration*.


### The Dominant Case: Scale Demand Up

In most entrepreneurial decisions, fixed costs are incurred to serve a population larger than the original sample. In these cases, demand must be scaled up to that population before profit can be evaluated meaningfully.

This applies whether fixed costs are:

- large and infrastructure-heavy, or
- intentionally small and founder-driven.

In both cases, the question is the same:

> *Can demand—scaled to the relevant population—plausibly support this level of commitment?*




### Low-Commitment Designs Are Not “Scaled-Down” Analyses

Some ventures deliberately operate with very low fixed costs in early stages.

This is not a case of “scaling fixed costs down to the sample.”  
It is a case of *choosing a design with minimal commitments*.

Those commitments should still be named honestly, and demand should still be evaluated at the population the design can realistically serve.

The analysis does not shrink costs to fit the data.  
It asks whether the data—appropriately scaled—can justify the design as it exists.


### A Rare Exception: When Scaling Disappears

In a small number of businesses, both demand and cost are already expressed *per unit at market scale*.

This occurs when:

- production is handled through contract manufacturing,
- costs are usage-based or per-transaction,
- or infrastructure and capacity are embedded upstream.

In these cases, demand evidence and cost structure are already aligned. No explicit population scaling is required, because the scale assumption is built into the unit cost itself.

This does *not* mean scale is irrelevant.  
It means scale has been assumed earlier—through the cost model rather than through population estimates.

Because this case is rare and easy to misapply, it should be stated explicitly when it applies and avoided otherwise.


### The Real Mistake to Avoid

The danger is not choosing the “wrong” scaling approach.

The danger is allowing:

- fixed commitments to imply scale silently, or
- demand evidence to be interpreted at the wrong level.

Profit reasoning only works when demand, cost, and scale are aligned *deliberately*.








## Step 5: Acknowledge Staged Commitment Paths

Some ventures are intentionally designed to operate with:

- zero or near-zero fixed costs,
- founder labor substituted for infrastructure,
- and narrow scale.

This is not a flaw.

It is a *strategy*.

In these cases, the scale question becomes:

> *Can this design generate sufficient margin at small scale to sustain the venture long enough to justify the next commitment?*

This reframes scale as a *path*, not a destination.

Sensitivity analysis then becomes a tool for asking:

- how long that stage can be sustained,
- what breaks first,
- and what must be true to advance responsibly.

Low commitment does not mean no commitment.

The table below shows how to name fixed costs honestly at the stage you are actually operating.

#### Demonstration of Fixed Costs at the Current Commitment Stage

This table is used to name **fixed costs honestly at the stage you are actually operating**, including low- or no-infrastructure designs.

Its purpose is to clarify what must be supported *before* revenue is known.

| Fixed Cost Component | Why It Exists at This Stage | What It Enables | What Breaks If It Increases | Confidence |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| Founder compensation | Sustain full-time effort | Continuous learning and execution | Founder burnout / exit | Medium |
| Basic software tools | Coordination and delivery | Reliable operations | Manual workarounds | High |
| Minimal marketing spend | Initial awareness | Demand learning | No inbound interest | Low |
| Legal / compliance | Ability to operate | Reduced legal risk | Forced shutdown | Medium |
| **Total fixed commitment** | — | Enables current design | Requires scaled demand | Medium |

**Interpretation:**  
These costs are not “temporary” because they are small.  
They are *deliberate commitments* whose justification depends on scaled demand.





## Step 6: Produce Decision-Grade Scale Bounds

Your output should not be a single number.

It should be:

- a *conservative lower bound*,
- a *plausible base case*,
- and an *optimistic upper bound*.

Each bound should be accompanied by:

- the assumptions that generate it,
- and where those assumptions could fail.

A scale estimate is decision-grade when:

- you know which constraints matter most,
- you know which assumptions are fragile,
- and you know how wrong you could be before profit reasoning changes.

That is enough.








## Step 7: Connect Scale to Profit Reasoning

The final question this toolkit supports is not *“How big could this be?”* It is:

> *Does this level of demand plausibly support the commitments implied by this design—given how uncertain we still are?*

If the answer is:

- *yes, even under error* → proceed deliberately.
- *only if everything goes right* → redesign or delay.
- *no, under any reasonable assumption* → stop or rethink.

Scale does not validate ideas.  
It disciplines commitment.
