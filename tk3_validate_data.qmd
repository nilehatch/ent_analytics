# Validating and Stress-Testing Demand Evidence {#sec-toolkit-validate-demand-data-chapter .unnumbered}
<!-- *Guide* -->

This toolkit helps you assess whether your demand evidence is strong enough to inform a real decision—or whether it needs to be challenged, refined, or rebuilt.

Demand curves are not discovered. They are inferred.
Inference can be more or less credible.

The purpose of this toolkit is not to prove that your demand estimate is correct. Its purpose is to help you determine whether your evidence is *trustworthy enough* to act on—and where it might be fragile.



## How to Use This Toolkit

This toolkit assumes you have:

- completed the [problem framing toolkit](tk1_frame_problem.qmd),
- designed and executed a survey using the [survey design toolkit](tk2_survey_design),
- `and generated an initial demand estimate or curve`.

You should work through this toolkit *before* optimizing price, projecting profit, or making irreversible commitments.

If the evidence fails these checks, that is not a failure. It is a signal to learn more.



## Treat Demand as an Experiment, Not a Fact

The most common mistake entrepreneurs make is treating early demand estimates as if they were measurements rather than experiments.

Demand evidence is provisional. It reflects:

- assumptions embedded in question wording,
- the population sampled,
- the framing of the decision,
- and the realism of the scenario.

For this reason, demand curves should be treated like experimental results:

- subject to replication,
- sensitive to design choices,
- and open to challenge.

Confidence should come from *consistency across evidence*, not from a single clean output.



## Internal Coherence Checks

Begin by asking whether the evidence makes sense on its own terms.

**Questions to Ask**

- Do higher prices generally correspond to lower quantities?
- Are responses monotonic in the expected direction?
- Are there obvious contradictions in individual responses?
- Do appeal ratings align loosely with willingness to pay?

**Design Insight**
Perfect smoothness is not expected. But demand evidence that violates basic intuition without explanation should be treated cautiously.

If the data requires heroic interpretation to be plausible, something is wrong.



## Segment Consistency Checks

Next, examine whether differences in demand align with customer characteristics.

**Questions to Ask**

- Do respondents who experience the problem more intensely show higher WTP?
- Are frequent users more price tolerant than occasional users?
- Are certain segments driving most of the apparent demand?

**Why This Matters**
If variation in willingness to pay is systematic, it strengthens confidence that you are observing real structure rather than noise.

If variation appears random or unrelated to meaningful characteristics, the evidence may be fragile—or the customer definition may be wrong.



## Boundary and Plausibility Checks

Demand evidence is especially useful for identifying boundaries.

**Questions to Ask**

- Are there prices at which demand plausibly falls to zero?
- Are there prices that appear implausibly high given the context?
- Does estimated demand imply volumes that strain operational reality?

These checks are not about pessimism. They are about realism.

Demand estimates that imply implausible outcomes should be re-examined before being used to justify commitments.



## Replication Through a Follow-Up Test

One of the most powerful validation techniques is simple replication.

Select one or two prices implied by your demand estimate and ask a *new* sample a focused question:

- “At a price of X, would you buy one unit in the next [period]?”

The goal is not precision. The goal is alignment.

If the fraction of “yes” responses is broadly consistent with what your demand curve predicts at that price, confidence increases.

If the results diverge substantially, something in the original design or transformation deserves scrutiny.



## Sensitivity to Assumptions

Demand estimates often rely on assumptions—especially when quantity is inferred rather than directly observed.

Ask explicitly:

- What assumptions did we make to construct this curve?
- How sensitive are conclusions to those assumptions?
- Would the decision change under reasonable alternative interpretations?

Evidence that supports a decision across a range of plausible assumptions is far more valuable than evidence that only supports it under one narrow reading.



## Knowing When Evidence Is “Enough”

There is no rule that determines when demand evidence is sufficient.

Instead, ask a disciplined question:

- Does additional data have a reasonable chance of changing the decision?

If the answer is yes, learning should continue.
If the answer is no, further precision may be unnecessary.

Good demand learning does not eliminate uncertainty. It reduces uncertainty to the point where judgment can be exercised responsibly.



## Acting Without Illusions

Validated demand evidence does not guarantee success.

It does something more important: it protects you from acting on false confidence.

Entrepreneurs still make judgment calls. Markets still surprise. Execution still matters.

But decisions informed by disciplined demand learning are different from guesses dressed up as analysis.

They are decisions you can stand behind—even when outcomes are uncertain.

That is the standard this toolkit is meant to support.
