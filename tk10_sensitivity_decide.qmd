# Use Sensitivity to Decide What to Learn Next {#sec-toolkit-sensitivity .unnumbered}

#### *Turning Fragility Into Learning Priorities*

Once profit has been correctly interpreted, the question changes.

The question is no longer whether profit is possible or fragile.

It becomes:

> *Which assumptions matter enough to justify learning, delay, or redesign—before committing further?*

This toolkit exists to answer that question.

It does not help you optimize profit.  
It helps you **decide what to pay attention to next**.


::: {.callout-note title="How this toolkit fits" icon=false collapse=true}
This toolkit builds directly on the toolkit for [*reading a profit curve*](tk9_read_profit.qmd).

It assumes you can already recognize:

- impossible profit,
- fragile profit,
- and robust profit.

Sensitivity does not replace that judgment.
It sharpens it by revealing *where being wrong would matter most*.
:::


## Step 1: Treat Every Input as a Belief, Not a Fact

Profit estimates rest on assumptions.

Some are well supported.  
Others are weak guesses.  
All are uncertain.

Sensitivity analysis begins by reframing inputs as beliefs rather than facts:

- demand shape,
- willingness to pay,
- variable cost per unit,
- fixed commitments,
- scale and access assumptions.

The goal is not to eliminate uncertainty.  
It is to understand *which uncertainty matters*.






## Step 2: Ask the Right Sensitivity Question

Sensitivity is often misunderstood.

The question is *not*:

> *Which variable moves profit the most?*

The correct question is:

> *Which assumption, if wrong, would change the decision?*

An assumption can be

- highly uncertain but low consequence, or
- fairly certain but catastrophic if wrong.

Sensitivity focuses on consequence, not likelihood.






## Step 3: Vary One Assumption at a Time—Deliberately

To learn from sensitivity, change one assumption at a time while holding others fixed.

Typical candidates include:

- demand slope (price sensitivity),
- maximum willingness to pay,
- variable cost per unit,
- fixed cost magnitude or timing,
- achievable scale or access.

For each variation, observe:

- whether profit disappears,
- whether fragility worsens,
- or whether robustness remains.

The goal is not realism.
The goal is exposure.






## Step 4: Identify Decision-Critical Assumptions

An assumption is *decision-critical* if:

- small changes reverse feasibility, or
- reasonable error collapses profit, or
- robustness depends heavily on it being “just right.”

These assumptions deserve attention.

Others—even if uncertain—may not.






## Step 5: Sort Assumptions by Actionability

Not all sensitive assumptions should be treated the same.

Ask:

- *Can this assumption be tested further?*
- *Can it be influenced by design?*
- *Can commitment be delayed until it is clearer?*
- *Is it largely outside our control?*

This step prevents wasted effort.

Sensitivity without judgment leads to anxiety.
Sensitivity with judgment leads to strategy.






## Step 6: Decide the Next Responsible Move

Sensitivity analysis does not tell you what to do.  
It tells you what it would be irresponsible to ignore.

Common responses include:

- **Experiment**  
  When a sensitive assumption can be tested cheaply.

- **Delay commitment**  
  When fragility is high but learning is ongoing.

- **Redesign**  
  When the structure itself creates unnecessary exposure.

- **Proceed deliberately**  
  When robustness exists despite uncertainty.

- **Stop**  
  When the decision fails under any reasonable assumption.

Each response is valid.
What matters is that it is chosen consciously.






## Step 7: Use Sensitivity to Allocate Attention, Not Precision

Sensitivity analysis is not about fine-tuning numbers.

It is about deciding:

- what deserves more evidence,
- what can be tolerated as uncertain,
- and what must be resolved before commitment.

Time, money, and focus are scarce.

Sensitivity helps you spend them where they matter most.


## What This Toolkit Refuses to Do

This toolkit does *not*:
- forecast future outcomes,
- or guarantee success.

It exists for a narrower—and more important—purpose:

> *To prevent commitment based on fragile assumptions that have not earned that privilege.*





## Where This Leaves the Decision

By the end of this toolkit, you should be able to say:

- which assumptions your decision depends on most,
- how much error you can tolerate,
- and whether further learning is warranted before committing.

At that point, analytics has done its job.

What remains is judgment.

Sensitivity does not remove uncertainty.  
It ensures you know *where uncertainty still matters*.

That is the discipline that makes pre-revenue decisions responsible rather than hopeful.
