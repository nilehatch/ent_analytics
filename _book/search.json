Unlike established businesses, startups face a unique challenge: uncertainty, not risk. Where risk is calculable, uncertainty defies quantification. Entrepreneurs often embark on ventures with minimal information, relying on assumptions about customers, markets, and costs. Success hinges on their ability to navigate this uncertainty, yet many rely on intuition and luck, leading to the staggering failure rates commonly associated with startups.\nUncertainty in entrepreneurship manifests in two forms:\nThe goal of this book is to equip entrepreneurs with the tools to tackle epistemic uncertainty, reducing reliance on intuition and improving decision-making through evidence.",

The importance of cost is simple: if your cost exceeds your revenue, your business won’t be sustainable. Every dollar saved on costs is as valuable as an extra dollar of revenue.\nCost Structure: The cost structure is a crucial concept—it’s about how much of your costs are fixed and how much are variable. Some businesses operate with hardly any fixed costs but have higher variable cost for each unit sold. Others might have significant fixed costs, but very low costs per unit.\nYour startup’s cost structure isn’t just happenstance; it’s a result of strategic decisions, much like your revenue model. The way you choose to serve your customers—a high fixed-cost model with everything in-house, or a variable-cost model relying on outsourced services—affects both your initial investment and your ongoing expenses.\nKeep in mind, your chosen cost structure dictates the kind of solutions you can offer. Not all cost structures can support the same solutions, and the most effective solution isn’t always the most cost-effective one.\nSelecting a cost structure is as fundamental as choosing how and when to invest in the resources that will become your fixed costs. Understanding the nature of your costs is the first step towards making informed decisions about your business’s financial future.",

    "section": "7.2 The Nature of Cost",
    "text": "7.2 The Nature of Cost\nCosts are the sum of all expenses a business incurs to produce and deliver its services or products, encompassing everything from labor to utilities. These costs define how a business allocates its resources and sets prices.\n\nTotal Cost\nTotal cost reflects the entire expense of producing a given level of output in a period of time. It’s critical to understand that while historical data often inform cost analyses in existing companies, entrepreneurs must instead estimate future costs to make informed decisions. Without historical data to rely on, we typically forecast a linear approximation of total costs, such as\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\mathsf{C} &= \\mathsf{cQ + f}  \\\\\n           &= \\mathsf{50\\,000 + 200\\ Q}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathsf{C}\\) is total cost, \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is the variable cost per unit, \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is the fixed cost and \\(\\mathsf{cQ}\\) is the total variable cost.\nBefore revenue, you will typically have complete knowledge of your future variable and fixed costs. As your business evolves and you gather actual data, these cost functions can be refined.\nUnderstanding the composition of total costs is foundational. Fixed costs, like rent, remain constant regardless of output levels. Variable costs, such as materials and labor, fluctuate with production volume. The interplay of these costs dictates pricing strategies and potential profit margins.\nThe relationship between fixed and variable costs, and their total, is illustrated in Figure 7.1, where the fixed cost is \\(\\mathsf{ f = 50\\, 000}\\) and the variable cost per unit \\(\\mathsf{c = 200}\\) is the rate at which total cost rises as quantity increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Measures of Total Cost\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurs must navigate these concepts with both foresight and flexibility to build a sustainable cost structure for their ventures.\n\n\nUnit Costs\nUnderstanding unit costs is imperative for businesses to ensure they price their products or services appropriately. It’s not merely about covering total costs but also ensuring each unit sold contributes to the overall financial health of the business. Unit costs, also known as “cost per unit,” refer to the cost incurred by a company to produce, store, and sell one unit of a particular product or service. This measure is crucial for businesses to calculate in order to set appropriate selling prices, determine break-even points, and strategize for profitability. Unit costs can be broken down into various components, such as:\n\nAverage Total Cost (ATC)\nThis is the total cost of production divided by the number of units produced. It encompasses all costs, both fixed and variable, averaged over all units of output. The formula for ATC is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\mathsf{ATC} &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{C}{Q}} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{f + cQ}{Q}} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{50\\, 000 + 200Q}{Q}} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{50\\, 000}{Q} + 200}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nWe can see that average total cost ATC comprises average fixed cost and average variable cost.\nIf the chosen price of a product is below the ATC, it may be unsustainable to enter the market or continue operations. The equation for ATC often highlights the benefits of economies of scale – as production increases, the fixed cost contribution per unit decreases, potentially lowering the ATC.\n\n\nAverage Variable Cost\nAverage variable cost (AVC) specifically looks at the costs that vary with production. Keeping prices above AVC is crucial in the short run to ensure a business isn’t operating at a loss. This measure helps in making incremental production decisions, especially when considering the minimum price at which it’s viable to keep producing.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\mathsf{AVC} &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{VC}{Q}} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{cQ}{Q} = c} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{200Q}{Q} = 200}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nMarginal Cost\nMarginal cost (MC) represents the cost of producing one additional unit. In a linear cost model, the marginal cost is constant and identical to average variable cost, simplifying decision-making. It’s vital for making informed decisions about increasing or decreasing production levels and for setting competitive prices.\nThese unit cost measures are visually represented in Figure 7.2, allowing for a clearer understanding of the cost implications at different production levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Measures of Unit Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime and Cost: The Short-Run vs. The Long-Run\nThe perspective on what constitutes a fixed or a variable cost can shift based on the time frame considered. In the short run, certain costs are fixed because the firm’s scale of operations cannot be adjusted quickly— for example, the rent for a factory. In the long run, as the firm has the opportunity to adjust its scale of operations, these costs become variable.\nThus, the categorization of costs as fixed or variable is less about the nature of the cost itself and more about the firm’s ability to modify these costs within a given time frame. This time sensitivity is crucial in strategic planning, as it influences the flexibility of a business to adapt to market changes and manage its cost structure for sustainable growth.\n\n\nFixed costs vs. Sunk Costs\nFixed costs and sunk costs are often conflated but they have differences that are important in making decisions about investments in infrastructure that increases fixed costs. Here’s a detailed look at the differences between the two and how they relate to decision-making:\n\nFixed Costs\nFixed costs are business expenses that remain unchanged regardless of the level of production or sales. These costs are “fixed” over a specified period and do not fluctuate with the volume of output. Examples include rent, salaries of permanent employees, depreciation of machinery, and insurance. These are costs a company incurs just for being in business, whether it produces anything or not.\nFixed costs can sometimes be altered or eliminated, but this usually requires a strategic shift or long-term planning. For example, a company might relocate to a cheaper facility or downsize its staff to reduce its fixed costs.\n\n\nSunk Costs\nSunk costs, on the other hand, are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. They are “sunk” because they are past expenditures that can no longer be affected by current or future actions. For instance, if a company invests in research and development for a product that it later decides not to produce, the money spent on R&D is a sunk cost.\nSunk costs should not influence future business decisions since they cannot be recovered or changed. However, businesses and individuals often fall prey to the “sunk cost fallacy,” where they continue investing in a project due to the amount already spent, rather than based on future viability.\n\n\nDecision-Making and Cost\nIn decision-making, particularly within economics, it’s essential to focus on relevant costs which include opportunity costs and incremental costs. Opportunity costs represent the benefits a business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. Incremental costs are the additional costs incurred when making business decisions, such as producing additional units.\nOpportunity Cost: This is the cost of the next best alternative that is foregone when a decision is made. It’s the value of what you could have done versus what you actually chose to do.\nIncremental Cost: When comparing options, it’s the additional cost over the current expenditure. It’s crucial for decision-makers to consider incremental costs rather than sunk costs because they reflect the potential future impact of decisions.\n\n\nAccounting vs. Economic Perspective\nAccounting: From an accounting standpoint, sunk costs are recognized and cannot typically be adjusted. They are recorded as they are incurred and may affect overall profitability.\nFinance: In finance, particularly when conducting cash flow analysis, the timing of cost recovery is crucial. Fixed costs that can be recovered, such as through the sale of an asset, are considered when calculating the net present value or internal rate of return.\nEconomics: Economists consider only those costs that can affect future decisions. Sunk costs are irrelevant to future economic decision-making because they do not change regardless of the outcome of future events.\nUnderstanding the difference between fixed and sunk costs is vital in making informed decisions that affect the economic health of a company. Decision-makers must look beyond past investments (sunk costs) and focus on the costs and benefits that can be influenced by their decisions (incremental and opportunity costs).\n\n\n\nCost Structure and the Business Model\nLet’s explore the relationship between cost structure and the business model. We choose both the cost structure and the business model and both need to be taken into account because different business models inherently have different cost implications:\n\nProduction Revenue Model\n\nVariable Costs: These include costs that vary with production volume such as raw materials, inventory costs, piece-rate labor (wages paid per unit produced), and sales commissions that are tied directly to the number of units sold.\nFixed Costs: Costs that remain constant regardless of production volume, such as salaries for management, costs related to the manufacturing facility, equipment, and general overhead.\n\nRetail Revenue Model\n\nVariable Costs: In a retail environment, the variable costs mainly consist of the cost of goods sold (purchases of inventory that will be resold) and sales commissions if applicable.\nFixed Costs: The costs of operating a retail space (rent, utilities, etc.), purchasing staff salaries, and general overhead expenses remain fixed.\n\nLicensing Revenue Model\n\nVariable Costs: For a licensing model, the costs that vary with the number of licenses sold could include sales commissions and legal costs for drafting and enforcing contracts.\nFixed Costs: The substantial investments in research and development (R&D) to create the intellectual property (IP), and the legal costs associated with securing IP rights (patents, copyrights, trademarks).\n\n\n\nScalability Challenges\n\nLabor-Intensive Solutions: Businesses that rely heavily on human labor (like consulting or teaching) are less scalable because costs increase linearly with revenue. To grow, you need to hire more people, and profit margins don’t significantly improve due to the proportional increase in labor costs.\nAsset-Intensive Solutions: For businesses that require physical assets like property or buildings, scaling up often means acquiring more assets, which leads to a proportional increase in costs relative to revenues.\n\n\n\nCost Structure and Profitability\n\nScalability and Margins: The ideal business model is one where costs do not grow at the same pace as revenues, allowing profit margins to increase with scale. Web-based solutions are a prime example, as they require minimal additional costs for serving additional customers, thus scaling effectively.\nTrade-off Between Fixed and Variable Costs: Investing in scalable fixed assets can often reduce variable costs and allow for better scalability. However, such fixed costs can be significant and challenging for entrepreneurs to fund, especially in the early stages of a startup.\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurial Challenges\nFor entrepreneurs, particularly in the startup phase, there is often a tension between the desire to invest in scalable assets and the reality of limited funds. This often results in a reliance on higher variable costs due to a lack of capital to invest in fixed, scalable assets. Entrepreneurs must navigate this trade-off while seeking funding sources that can support investments in assets that will help them scale more effectively in the long run.\nIn essence, the choice of business model and the resulting cost structure are crucial in determining how easily a business can scale and how its profitability will change as it grows.",

    "text": "7.4 Choosing a Cost Structure\n\nEarly Stages\n\nBootstrapping Phase: Startups often begin with minimal fixed costs; operating out of a free space and covering expenses via personal means, maintaining flexibility by using external services.\nCost Minimization: The goal is to keep fixed costs low until there is proof of demand for the product, thus avoiding unnecessary financial burdens.\n\n\n\nGrowth and Scaling\n\nInitial Growth: As the product gains market traction or investment is secured, the startup can afford to incur more fixed costs like office space and salaries.\nHiring Key Talent: Skilled professionals are brought on board to refine and build the product.\nFounder Compensation: Founders may start with modest salaries, their main compensation being the growing value of their equity.\n\n\n\nMaturation\n\nEstablished Presence: A successful venture with significant market share may invest in permanent assets, such as buildings, and start developing a more hierarchical structure.\nProfessional Management: The operational complexity may lead to the hiring of professional executives to manage the company’s growth and operations effectively.\n\n\n\nCost Structure Transition\nThe decision to shift from a lower fixed cost structure to a higher one depends on the company’s scale and its ability to cover fixed costs. Figure 7.3 shows how total costs vary with different ratios of fixed to variable costs, illustrating the optimal points for transitioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Choose the cost structure that minimizes cost at the level of scale (production or sales)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Decisions\n\nAvoid Premature Fixed Costs: Entrepreneurs should resist investing in large fixed assets too early, as customer needs and solutions are still evolving.\nIncremental Investments: It is advisable to gradually improve the product with a focus on adaptability, even if that means higher variable costs initially.\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Startups\n\nStartups should carefully assess when to transition to a cost structure with higher fixed costs.\nThe goal is to minimize costs at the current level of scale, avoiding the trap of scaling fixed costs too quickly which could lead to unprofitability.\nThe timing of these transitions is critical and can be guided by analyzing cost curves and scale of operations.\n\nThis provides a strategic framework for startups to consider when scaling their operations, emphasizing the importance of aligning cost structures with stages of growth and the inherent risks of moving too quickly into high fixed costs without the sales volume to support them. It is a crucial guide for entrepreneurs to understand the financial implications of growth and scale in the context of a startup lifecycle.\n\n\n\nThe Decision to Make or to Buy\nThe make-or-buy decision shapes your startup’s cost structure at a fundamental level. Producing goods in-house generally ramps up fixed costs due to the need for equipment, space, and expertise. On the other hand, procuring goods from a supplier increases variable costs, as you pay for their production plus a margin.\nConventional wisdom advocates for startups to purchase inputs, conserving resources to innovate on what can’t be bought. The challenge lies in discerning when it’s financially wiser to produce rather than purchase.\nPurchasing inputs can shift substantial fixed costs to the supplier, leaving your startup with higher variable costs. However, the total purchase cost may exceed in-house production if the supplier’s profit margin is steep. Alternatively, a supplier’s specialized operations can result in lower costs for you, even with their profit margin included.\n\nTransaction Costs\nWhen buying, consider transaction costs—the risk and governance expenses in transactions (Williamson 1975, 1985). Suppliers can falter, causing holdups that delay your operations. Contracts and strong relationships are governance mechanisms that reduce such risks, but in cases of significant holdup risk, in-house production might safeguard your startup’s future.\nEntrepreneurial decisions should weigh these transaction costs. For low-risk inputs, buying is typically safe. For high-risk inputs, manufacturing internally may be essential. Refer to Section 7.7 (Appendix A) for an in-depth analysis of transaction cost economics and the make-or-buy conundrum.",

It is made of slash resistant fabric in nondescript colors to avoid the attention that more popular colorful brands draw. Let’s look at the cost of having the Dorsal pack manufactured by a contract manufacturer. The manufacturer charges $40 per backpack to be manufactured, packaged, and delivered to the start-up’s offices. The start up is also spending $200 per month for web hosting and $5500 per month for contracted web development. Their total cost curve is linear: \\[ \\mathsf{C = cQ + f}\\] where \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is the variable cost per unit and \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is fixed cost per month.\n\nIn homework 2, we studied revenue models for the Dorsal travel pack. In this homework, we will continue the analysis by focusing on cost of the backpack.\n\n\nWhat is the variable cost per unit for the Dorsal pack?\nWhat is the average variable cost of producing and selling 32 Dorsal packs?\nWhat is the fixed cost per month?\nWhat is the total cost of the first 62 units?\nWhat is the total variable cost of 37 units?\nWhat is the total fixed cost of 75 units?\nWhat is average total cost of 43 units?\nInvesting in new cost structure: Like most start-ups in the early days, Dorsal pack has embraced a cost structure with low fixed costs and high variable costs. In the next stage of business model development, they are considering doing the packaging and order fulfillment themselves. In this scenario, the manufacturer would ship to the finished product in bulk to Dorsal’s headquarters. Without packaging, the manufacturing cost is $25. A single person can manage the packaging and order fulfillment operation once it is set up. The cost of setting up packaging and fulfillment operations is $16,000 per month. This cost is in addition to the fixed costs from original cost structure that will remain in the new cost structure. How many travel packs does Dorsal need to sell per month to justify moving to the new cost structure by investing in packaging and fulfillment? \n\nNote that you can use a ggplot with a layer for each function (using geom_function twice) to roughly find the point where two functions intersect. However, to know the precise value where intersection happens, you first create a new function that is the difference between the functions (f1intersect2 &lt;- function(x) f1(x) - f2(x)). Then use the package rootsolve (you will probably need to install it) to find the roots of the new function. When the difference between the functions is equal to zero, they have intersected one another. The syntax for using rootsolve is uniroot(f1m2, lower = #, upper = #) where lower = and upper = provide the values of \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) that are the lower bound and upper bound to search for the intersection.\nThe impact of pricing on cost:. We have been working with cost as a function of quantity which is traditional. However, we will normally make the pricing decision to tell us what the quantity demanded will be. To incorporate price into decisions about cost, just insert the demand curve \\(\\mathsf{Q(P)}\\) in place of the quantity variable in the cost equations. In the case of the Dorsal travel pack, we estimated the demand curve in Homework 1 and 2 to be \\(\\mathsf{Q_{dp} = e^{5.115604 - 0.011612\\cdot P}}\\).\n\nUsing this demand curve, what is the expected total cost when we set the price at $100?\n\nWhat is the average total cost when the price of a dorsal pack is $200?",

    "section": "7.7 Appendix A: Clarifying the Make-Buy Decision through Transaction Cost Economics",
    "text": "7.7 Appendix A: Clarifying the Make-Buy Decision through Transaction Cost Economics\nA common question that entrepreneurs face is whether to make a particular input to their solution or to buy it from a supplier. For example, a startup with a software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution needs a great deal of computing capacity to serve the customer needs that come from around the globe. Should the startup buy, host, and maintain its own web servers or should it contract with one of the many cloud computing providers? For a SAAS startup, the wisdom of ``buying everything you can’’ means that a contract provider of cloud computing should be used. When you consider the costs and hassles of buying, installing, maintaining, and securing the computers, it sounds logical to let the experts focus on their strength in computer hardware while the startup focuses on its expertise in building a software solution.\nMuch like the concept of opportunity cost, transaction costs often do not show up in the direct and indirect accounting costs of making and delivering your solution. As a result, it is easy to neglect or ignore the influence of transaction costs in your decisions. When transaction costs are large, ignoring them can lead to decisions that are very costly and even fatal to your company.\nThe risk of holdup demands governance mechanisms to facilitate transactions. Let’s first explore the factors that lead to the risk of holdup: uncertainty, bounded rationality, opportunism, and asset specificity. When there is certainty about a transaction or the markets of the supplier and the buyer, there is no risk of opportunism. If you are certain about what will happen, there will be no surprises and you will only transact if it is safe.\nWhen there is uncertainty, surprises happen. When there is uncertainty, it is not possible to write a fully contingent contract–one where every possible contingency is addressed and agreed upon—so the unexpected can happen to either or both of the transactors. Surprises often lead to unexpected problems that make it impossible to fulfill the terms of the contract and holdup happens. Uncertainty causes the parties to a transaction to have bounded rationality meaning that their ability to foresee and specify risks is limited. Since we all have limits to our rationality, especially in our ability to see through uncertainty, you must evaluate the risk of holdup in our transactions.\nSome suppliers are more trustworthy than others. Usually, you perceive that a supplier is less trustworthy because they show a tendency or a history of opportunism. Opportunism is a willingness to take advantage of the other party in a transaction, even resorting to guile to take advantage and get ahead. It is not necessary for every possible transactor to be opportunistic. It is not even necessary for one of the transactors of a particular transaction to be opportunistic. If there is uncertainty and you can not be sure that the other transactor is honest, the risk of opportunism is present and you must respond to it.\nSome inputs to your solution will be generic type inputs for which there are many competing suppliers competing in commodity markets to sell to you. Other inputs are specific to the transaction and open the door to holdup. A specific asset is one that cannot be redeployed to new uses if the transaction fails. The inability to redeploy the asset means that it is closely related to the sunk costs we discussed in Section 7.2.4.\nTo see the relationship between asset specificity and the risk of holdup, consider the case of injection molding. Injection molding, as the name suggests, injects a material into a mold to quickly produce a physical part in a desired shape. The mold must be created to exacting standards to produce the desired shape of the finished part. As a result, it can almost never be used in another application. We would say that the mold is an asset that is specific to the transaction for that particular molded part. The high degree of asset-specificity of the mold is the primary source of the risk of holdup. Once the molding company has incurred the cost of creating the mold, that cost is sunk. The buyer can come back to the supplier and demand a price reduction. Since the cost of the mold is sunk, the supplier has little leverage and will likely have to give in.\nWhen assets are highly specific to the transaction and the risk of opportunism is high, the transaction costs may be so high that transactions never happen. In practice, transactions between customers and suppliers of injection molding because the customer is required to buy the molds.\nTransaction cost economics identifies at least six types of asset specificity that raise the risk of holdup:\n\nSite Specificity: when a supplier locates production near a buyer, or vice versa, for the sake of lower transportation costs and increased coordination, the cost of relocating and the cost of changing suppliers increases;\nPhysical Asset Specificity: when a physical asset can only do one thing for one buyer, it cannot be redeployed and the risk of holdup increases;\nHuman Asset Specificity: when employees develop knowledge and skills that can only be used in a particular employer, the cost of the employee leaving is higher for both the employee and the firm;\nTemporal Specificity: when there is a window of opportunity after which value is lost such as in earning an on-time delivery bonus or earning a first-mover advantage, buyers are vulnerable to suppliers who are slow to deliver;\nDedicated Assets: when a customer invests in assets for a particular supplier or when a supplier invests in assets for a particular customer, the cost of redeploying the may be very high if it is even possible;\nBrand-name Capital: brand equity is tied to the firm that developed it and is difficult to transfer to another firm or brand. It is harder to build brand equity than to sustain it so firms with brand equity are vulnerable to firms who can damage it without damaging their own brand.\n\nThe risk of holdup threatens to derail transactions when the risk is particularly high. The solution is to implement a governance mechanism that reduces the risk of holdup to levels that allow transactions to proceed. We saw an example of a governance mechanism in the transactions for injection molding. The supplier requires the buyer to pay for the mold before the mold is built. Because the buyer bears the fixed cost, the primary opportunity for the buyer’s opportunism is eliminated. This particular governance mechanism is known as where the giving of a hostage (the molds) aligns the incentives of the buyer and the supplier and allows them to transact with confidence.\nThere are three primary categories of governance mechanisms with varying effectiveness in eliminating holdup cost. The first category is the spot market which is sometimes known as “cash and carry.” For example, if you need paper for your printer, you typically go to a retailer, give them cash, and carry away the paper. This governance mechanism is weakest in terms of reducing the risk of holdup but it is also the cheapest and easiest to implement. When the risk of holdup is low enough, it works well.\nAt the other extreme of the governance mechanism continuum is hierarchy which means that the transaction happens inside the hierarchy of the company. Hierarchy is a very powerful governance mechanism because even when there is high asset specificity, the risk of holdup is low. If one division of a company exercises opportunism against another division of the same company, the opportunistic division may be better off but the company is injured overall. An executive of the company can rein in the opportunistic division, sort out the differences and ensure a collective benefit for the company. The downside of hierarchy is that it is expensive. A new division of the company has to be formed; new employees and managers must be brought in and trained; new executives and executive responsibilities must be adopted; and coordination between divisions grows geometrically as the number of divisions grows.\nBetween the extremes of market and hierarchy is the hybrid category which contains elements of market and hierarchy. The simplest hybrid form is a contract that defines how the buyer and the seller will act under various contingencies. A contract is more effective than the spot market in overcoming the risk of holdup but it is more expensive in terms of contracting costs and coordination. A contract is less effective than hierarchy in overcoming holdup because courts must be used to resolve disputes but it is cheaper to set up and coordinate. Alliances, joint ventures, and franchises are additional forms of hybrid governance mechanisms. Each is closer to hierarchy than contracts and more effective in reducing holdup but also more expensive.\nWhile governance mechanisms are effective in reducing or eliminating the risk of holdup, their cost must be included in the total transaction cost. The total transaction cost is the sum of the cost of the governance mechanism and the cost of the remaining risk of holdup. The varying governance mechanisms have varying costs. In general, more effective governance mechanisms are also more expensive to implement and are only cost effective when the risk of holdup is high such as when there is high asset specificity. This insight is illustrated in Figure 7.4, adapted from Oliver Williamson (1985), where we see the cost of the governance mechanism graphed against the degree of asset specificity which directly causes the risk of holdup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Choosing Governance Mechanisms to Minimize Transaction Costs\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asset specificity is low, spot market governance works well and has a low cost. However, as asset specificity grows, the cost of governance using spot markets grows much faster due to the cost of monitoring, coordinating, and the cost of holdup. When there is no asset specificity, the hybrid governance mechanism has a higher cost than markets because of the cost of setting up legal contracts and coordination. With very low asset specificity, hybrid governance is a poor choice. As asset specificity rises, the cost of governance rises and eventually hybrid governance becomes the least expensive choice for moderate levels of asset specificity. In the absence of asset specificity, hierarchy is the most expensive governance mechanism. As asset specificity rises, the cost of governance rises more slowly so that hierarchy is the least expensive choice for high levels of asset specificity. The choice of appropriate governance mechanism is straightforward. Choose the mechanism that minimizes the transaction costs given the level of asset specificity.\nWhat does this mean for the entrepreneur? The debate over which inputs to make and which to buy is best resolved through the lens of transaction cost economics. The traditional wisdom is that entrepreneurs should buy every input they can. This is good advice for inputs with low asset specificity where spot markets can be used and for inputs with moderate asset specificity where contracts or partnerships can be used. In contrast, when asset specificity for a transaction for an input is high and the risk of holdup is also high, you are better off to make that input. Even when it is available to be purchased in the market, the risk of holdup is so high that the well-being of your startup is in jeopardy when you buy the input rather than make it.",

    "section": "7.8 Appendix B: Economies and Diseconomies of Scale",
    "text": "7.8 Appendix B: Economies and Diseconomies of Scale\nThere are diverse reasons why average total cost falls as scale increases. The primary reason is the spreading of fixed costs over more units sold. On top of that, economies of scale may result from increased efficiency as scale increases.\n\nEconomies of Scale\n\nProduct-Specific Economies of Scale\nThese economies of scale are associated with the volume of a single product.\n\nAt higher volumes, specialized investments in machines and human capital (both R&D and production) allow for production methods that reduce the cost per unit. In particular, labor costs decrease due to increases in proficiency as well as fewer errors per unit. For example, in ball bearing manufacturing, production of less than 100 rings is done by hand on general purpose lathes. For production between 100 – 1,000,000 rings, production is done with a specialized screw machine. For production greater than 1,000,000 rings, production is done with an even more specialized high speed, continuous process machine.\nIncreased bargaining power in procuring raw materials/inputs decreases the cost of raw material inputs.\n\n\n\nPlant-Specific Economies of Scale\nThese economies of scale are associated with the total output of an entire plant.\n\nEfficiency gains that result from expanding the size of individual processing units and sharing plant costs across several related products (e.g., procurement, inventory management/receiving, transportation/distribution). These types of efficiency gains are\nEnergy usage — rises less than proportionately with increases in processing size.\nLabor — crews required to operate a large processing unit or machine are often no larger than what is needed for a unit with smaller capacity.\nMassed reserves — lower costs for back-up of specialized machines (e.g. you need a back-up if you have one or five machines running). Fewer maintenance personnel are required per machine/plant; also useful when unit/machine shutdowns occur regularly and predictably.\n\n\n\nEconomies of Multi-Plant Operations\nThese economies of scale are associated with total corporate size.\n\nEconomies of scale in centralized service functions, such as R&D and management/staff. Costs per unit are lower by having a common central pool of researchers, financial planners, accountants, purchasing agents, lawyers, etc.\nValue of experimentation and diversity of operations wherein knowledge from one plant can be transferred to other plants. Shared production experience (best demonstrated practices) across plants can increase efficiency.\nEconomies of scale in raising capital through common stock issues and borrowing. For example, firms with $200 mm in assets borrow on average at 0.74 percentage points less than $5 mm asset firms; $1 billion asset firms borrow for 1.08 percentage points less. (1960’s; Scherer et al.) This is due to reduced variance in profits (lower perceived risk). The CAPM pricing model is typically used to assess risk and even one bad year of earnings is perceived as a trend. Thus, larger companies in more concentrated industries have lower Betas. Also, a firm of $500 mm assets can borrow $25 mm at close to the prime rate but if it tries to borrow $100 - 500 mm in a short time frame, it will have to pay a steep interest premium. Such capital market imperfections may contribute to concentration in capital intensive industries like steel, autos, petrol. refining, etc., requiring a very high capital investment for minimum efficient scale (MES) operation. Small competitors may have considerable difficulty financing a great leap forward in MES operation.\nEconomies of scale in advertising which allow you to achieve a “minimum threshold” of advertising messages to influence the consumer; however, above the minimum threshold at some point there appears to be diminishing returns to advertising. (e.g., according to reports, some beer drinkers deluged with Budweiser ads, said, “Give me anything but a Bud.”)\nThe ability to locate plants to reduce distribution/transportation costs associated with getting the product to the end user (e.g. especially with low value to bulk items or items with special distribution properties like ice, dairy products, cement, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nDiseconomies of Scale\nIt is common for diseconomies of scale to exist as well as economies of scale. When there are diseconomies of scale, average total cost rises as the scale increases. Diseconomies of scale typically occur when increasing marginal costs outweigh the advantages of spreading fixed cost and the average cost rises.\n%For many firms, there are also observed ranges of output that exhibit diseconomies of scale. Over these ranges, average cost is rising as output increases.\nDiseconomies of scale put limits on scale and complicate efforts to realize the cost advantages of economies of scale. Reasons for diseconomies of scale include\n\nDiminishing returns to scale economies—with large enough volume, set-up costs dwindle to insignificance. %Learning curves flatten.\nPsychological surveys show that for reasons not completely understood workers are less satisfied with jobs and challenges offered in large plants vs. small. Therefore, to attract the required work force, you need to pay a wage premium.\nIncreasing the workforce in a small town may require expanding the geographic radius from which workers are drawn; this increases commuting costs and results in higher offsetting wages.\nMaterial flows lengthen and become more complex; managing a large plant is more difficult than a small one, all things being equal. Typically, the larger the plant, the more decisions are made at higher levels by executives who are removed farther and farther from the reality of front line production.\nTransportation costs typically increase with fewer, larger plants, both in transporting inputs to the plant and finished products to the market, because fewer plants cannot be located as closely to their destinations.\nRisks of fire, explosion, wildcat strikes are at a maximum when all production is concentrated at a single plant site.",

    "text": "4.1 Why Study Demand?\nSuccessful innovations hinge on being desirable, feasible, and viable. These aspects are interdependent. If an innovation lacks desirability, feasibility alone can’t save it. If it’s not feasible, it can’t meet the desired level of performance. Without desirability and feasibility, viability is unattainable because it can’t sustainably fulfill customer needs. This interplay among desirability, feasibility, and viability defines entrepreneurship as an economic activity, where success is measured by value creation and long-term profitability.\nValue isn’t limited to financial profit; it can encompass outcomes like health, dignity, comfort, or spirituality, particularly in ventures with non-profit missions. Even when value isn’t financial, it’s often referred to as profit for measurement purposes, and profitability is a key success metric.\nProfit is typically calculated as revenue minus cost, expressed as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathsf{\\pi} &= \\mathsf{Revenue - Cost} \\\\        \n     &= \\mathsf{R - C} \\\\        \n     &= \\mathsf{PQ - cQ -F}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathsf{\\pi}\\) represents profit, \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) is revenue, \\(\\mathsf{C}\\) is cost, \\(\\mathsf{P}\\) is price, \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) is quantity, \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is variable cost, and \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) is fixed cost. To achieve viability, a venture must consistently generate positive profit. Notably, the quantity variable \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) represents demand for the solution at the price \\(\\mathsf{P}\\). Demand is a foundational factor in assessing expected profitability.\nThe surest route to entrepreneurial success is identifying customers with a genuine need and addressing it with a solution. Regardless of the innovation’s technical superiority or other accolades, without customer demand, it won’t succeed commercially. “Better” must be defined in terms of solving customer problems.\nFrom an economic perspective, discovering customer problems equates to finding demand curves. When customers have a problem they want solved, they will “demand” your solution. Conversely, if there’s no demand, even the most remarkable solution will fail commercially. Finding your customers’ demand curve for your solution and analyzing price and revenue potential based on it is crucial.\nIn established companies, profit components are derived from accounting data. However, in startups, evidence-based decisions require calculating expected profit using demand. In this chapter, we’ll delve into demand curves, their properties, and, most importantly, how to collect customer preference data to identify the demand curve. Armed with this knowledge, we can construct revenue, cost, and profit curves to assess the long-term viability of the venture.",

    "section": "4.2 Demand Curves",
    "text": "4.2 Demand Curves\nA demand curve is a critical concept in understanding customer behavior and revenue generation. It represents the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity customers are willing to buy. Let’s break it down further:\n\nDemand Curve Definition: A demand curve is essentially a graph or mathematical equation that shows how much customers value a product at different prices. In its simplest form, it can be expressed as \\(\\mathsf{Q = a - bP}\\), where \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) is the quantity, and \\(\\mathsf{P}\\) is the price. For example, Figure 4.1 shows this demand curve graphically. The intercept is 2000 units meaning that 2000 units will be sold when price is $0. For every dollar increase in price, demand falls by 2 units. This demand curve implies that at a price of $750, customers will buy 500 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Demand Curve: Q = 2000 - 2P\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Demand: The law of demand states that as the price of a product rises, customers tend to buy less of it, and as the price falls, they buy more. This aligns with common shopping behavior: when something becomes more expensive, we often seek alternatives.\nFactors Influencing Demand: While price is a significant factor, demand curves can be influenced by other variables like income, advertising, and the prices of other goods. A complete demand curve takes these factors into account through a more complex equation, such as \\[\\mathsf{Q_x(P_x) = a - bP_x + cP_y + dM + \\ldots}\\]where \\(\\mathsf{P_x}\\) is the price of the product in question, \\(\\mathsf{P_y}\\) is the price of another good, and \\(\\mathsf{M}\\) is income.\nChanges in Demand vs. Quantity Demanded: When factors other than the price of the product change, the entire demand curve shifts. As Figure 4.2 illustrates, this movement from point A to C is known as a change in demand. Conversely, a change in quantity demanded occurs when only the price of the product changes, causing movement along the demand curve from point A to B. For example, an increase in income might lead to a higher demand for a product, shifting the demand. This distinction is important when we work with demand curves with more variables than just price. As you may intuit from the graph, the effect of non-price variables is to change the intercept of the demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Change in Demand vs. Change in Quantity Demanded\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand curves are powerful tools for understanding customer behavior and making informed business decisions. They help businesses set appropriate prices, predict customer responses to price changes, and identify the impact of various external factors on product demand.",

    "text": "4.3 Price Sensitivity\nIn traditional economics, much emphasis is placed on the concept of price elasticity, which measures how sensitive customers are to changes in prices. Price-sensitive customers are always on the lookout for discounts and quickly reduce their purchases when prices rise slightly. For well-established companies with ample transaction data and small, infrequent price changes, studying price sensitivity through elasticity makes sense—it helps optimize profit.\nHowever, in the entrepreneurial context, where we often lack transaction data and need to directly engage with customers to estimate demand curves across a wide price range, a different approach is more practical. Rather than analyzing price sensitivity indirectly through elasticity, we will focus on how to directly find and estimate demand curves. This approach allows us to analyze everything we need without the need for elasticity calculations.\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into elasticity, you can explore the appendix in Section 4.7.",

    "text": "4.4 Where do we get demand curves?\nIn the realm of economics, demand curves play a pivotal role in understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics. These curves provide insights into how consumers respond to changes in prices and other variables, guiding businesses in their decision-making processes. However, acquiring accurate demand curves has often been regarded as a complex task, typically requiring the expertise of economists and statisticians with advanced degrees. Large corporations usually have the resources to employ such experts, enabling them to make informed strategic choices based on well-defined demand curves.\nYet, the landscape is different for most businesses, especially entrepreneurial startups. These ventures often lack the luxury of dedicated economists and statisticians, making them vulnerable to competitive pressures resulting from less-informed decisions. Traditionally, in economics education, students are cautioned about the challenges of statistically determining demand curves. These curves can be elusive due to various factors, including the complex interplay between supply and demand, historical data biases, and endogeneity. As a result, economics textbooks and courses typically provide demand curves as given, and students are not encouraged to delve into the intricate process of estimating them.\nThe good news, however, is that startups can sidestep the complexities traditionally associated with estimating demand curves. In the modern business landscape, many entrepreneurs are already collecting data as part of their efforts to validate their business models. This process, often referred to as customer development, revolves around confirming whether customers indeed face the problems that a solution aims to address and whether they genuinely desire that solution. If customers do not resonate with the problem-solution fit, entrepreneurs will likely encounter limited demand and customers who are highly price-sensitive.\nSo, how can startups navigate the demand curve challenge without the need for specialized economists? The answer lies in understanding the concept of “willingness to pay.” Think of a demand curve as a lineup of your customers, standing shoulder to shoulder, ranked in descending order of their willingness to pay – the maximum amount a customer would be willing to pay for a unit of your solution. In essence, willingness to pay is equivalent to a price point.\nBy harnessing your knowledge of customers’ willingness to pay, you already possess the fundamental elements necessary to estimate a demand curve. This process is more straightforward and less prone to the statistical complexities associated with traditional demand curve estimation. It primarily involves three steps:\n\nCollect willingness to pay Data: Gather data on customers’ willingness to pay, effectively using it as a proxy for price.\nUse willingness to pay Data for Quantity Calculation: Utilize the willingness to pay data to calculate the corresponding quantities customers are willing to purchase at various price points.\nEstimate the Demand Curve: Apply regression analysis to the price-quantity data, allowing you to construct an accurate demand curve. In the subsequent sections, we will delve into these steps in greater detail, exploring how to obtain the data and transform it into valuable insights for your startup.\n\n\nCollect Willingness to Pay Data\nGaining insights into your customers’ willingness to pay is crucial for understanding demand. To collect this data effectively, follow these steps:\n\nDescribe the Solution: Begin by providing a comprehensive description of your product or service. Ensure respondents understand your solution as if they were making a purchase. Even in the early stages, offer the best and most recent description possible.\nAsk Customers Their Willingness to Pay: After describing the solution, convey your commitment to addressing your customers’ problems and improving their lives through your solution. Ask them, “What is the most you would be willing to pay for this solution?” Record their responses, preferably in a spreadsheet.\n\nKeep in mind that respondents may provide flawed estimates as they may not fully consider all factors involved in an actual transaction. Some may overestimate their willingness to pay during a survey, while others may underestimate it. However, willingness to pay data still provides remarkably accurate insights into demand.\n\nAvoid softening the question by naming a specific price and asking if they would buy at that price, as this limits the richness of the data you can gather. Remember that asking this question is not impolite when you genuinely offer a solution to a real problem. Non-customers’ responses, which tend to be biased, should be avoided as they may lead to incorrect validation or rejection of your idea.\n\n\nMinimize Sampling Bias: Gather data primarily from your target customers to avoid non-relevant responses that can distort your findings.\nSample Enough Customers: While a larger sample size is generally better, focus more on refining your understanding of the questions and sampling the right customers. Small, inexpensive samples (30–50 responses) are suitable for refining your understanding, but larger, more expensive samples are needed when seeking a representative demand curve.\n\n\nCollect Customer Characteristic Data: Over time, your understanding of your customers will evolve. To aid this process, request basic demographic information, such as age, gender, income level, education, job category, and geography. As you refine your hypotheses, add new questions about customer characteristics to narrow your focus to real customers while minimizing bias in your sampling.\n\nBy gathering willingness to pay data and continually refining your understanding of your customers, you can better identify your target audience and tailor your efforts to serve them effectively.\n\n\nUse Willingness to Pay Data to Calculate Quantity\nAs established in Section 4.2, a demand curve essentially illustrates the relationship between price and the quantity that consumers are willing to consume at that price. Willingness to pay data provides a proxy for price but where do we get the quantity variable? Let’s look first at the class of products known as durable goods which, as the name implies, are items that endure over time and are not fully consumed in their initial use, such as cars, personal computers, or houses.\nTypically, consumers do not purchase more than one unit of a durable good within a short time frame because these products provide sustained value. Consequently, when dealing with durable goods, the quantity of consumers willing to buy is often synonymous with the quantity of the product sold at a given price. In simpler terms, you can count the number of consumers willing to buy at a specific price, and that number represents the quantity demanded at that price.\nLet’s consider a sample of willingness to pay data to illustrate this concept. Willingness to pay responses for 27 respondents are given in Table 4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrespondent\nwtp\n\n\n\n\n1\n15.00\n\n\n2\n5.00\n\n\n3\n20.00\n\n\n4\n15.00\n\n\n5\n12.00\n\n\n6\n0.00\n\n\n7\n10.00\n\n\n8\n35.00\n\n\n9\n17.00\n\n\n10\n0.00\n\n\n11\n20.00\n\n\n12\n0.00\n\n\n13\n22.99\n\n\n14\n25.00\n\n\n15\n15.00\n\n\n16\n0.00\n\n\n17\n10.00\n\n\n18\n15.00\n\n\n19\n0.00\n\n\n20\n0.00\n\n\n21\n20.00\n\n\n22\n3.00\n\n\n23\n15.00\n\n\n24\n30.00\n\n\n25\n15.00\n\n\n26\n20.00\n\n\n27\n23.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Willingness to pay for each of 27 respondents.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, you can observe that two respondents were willing to pay $30 or more for the product, and six out of 27 respondents indicated they would not pay anything, which raises concerns about non-target customers.\nThe first step in converting this willingness to pay data into quantity data is to count how frequently the unique values of willingness to pay were named. In our example, there are 13 unique values of willingness to pay named by the 27 respondents. The unique values and the count of how frequently they were named are given in Table 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtp\ncount\n\n\n\n\n0.00\n6\n\n\n3.00\n1\n\n\n5.00\n1\n\n\n10.00\n2\n\n\n12.00\n1\n\n\n15.00\n6\n\n\n17.00\n1\n\n\n20.00\n4\n\n\n22.99\n1\n\n\n23.00\n1\n\n\n25.00\n1\n\n\n30.00\n1\n\n\n35.00\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Unique values of willingness to pay for the product named by the respondents and a count of how frequently each willingness to pay value was named.\n\n\n\n\nCount is similar to quantity but will not really serve as a measure of quantity because it neglects the impact of the law of demand. If you were to accept count as your quantity variable, your demand curve would imply that six units are consumed at a price of $15.00 but only one unit is consumed at a price of $12. The law of demand requires that quantity increase as price falls so count violates that law. We can restate the law of demand to say that anyone who would buy at a higher price would also buy at a lower price. This means that the respondent who is willing to pay $35 is also willing to pay $30 and should be included in the quantity data for $30; the respondent who is willing to pay \\$30 and the respondent who is willing to pay \\$35 are both also willing to pay \\$25 and should be included in the quantity data for \\$25; and so on.\nTo calculate the quantity, start with the highest willingness to pay respondent and use that count as quantity. For the next highest willingness to pay value, add the count of that price to the quantity of the higher willingness to pay respondent. Continue accumulating these values through the lowest willingness to pay value.This cumulative sum approach ensures that the quantity at a lower price includes respondents who are also willing to buy at higher prices, adhering to the law of demand. The resulting price-quantity data can be used to estimate the demand curve for the durable good. The quantity and count variables are shown together with the willingness to pay variable in Table Table 4.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtp\ncount\nquantity\n\n\n\n\n35.00\n1\n1\n\n\n30.00\n1\n2\n\n\n25.00\n1\n3\n\n\n23.00\n1\n4\n\n\n22.99\n1\n5\n\n\n20.00\n4\n9\n\n\n17.00\n1\n10\n\n\n15.00\n6\n16\n\n\n12.00\n1\n17\n\n\n10.00\n2\n19\n\n\n5.00\n1\n20\n\n\n3.00\n1\n21\n\n\n0.00\n6\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Willingness to pay, count, and quantity data for demand estimation.\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, here’s a step-by-step approach to obtain quantity data from willingness to pay data:\n\nSort the willingness to pay data in ascending order.\nCount the number of respondents willing to pay at each unique price point.\nCalculate the quantity demanded at each price by cumulatively summing the count data.\n\n\n\nEstimate the Demand Curve\nIn the process of constructing a function of the expected profit to be earned by an innovation, we need the demand curve as the first building block. The demand curve is an equation that shows the quantity demanded at every price. We have data from representative consumers showing prices and the quantities that will be demanded at those prices. We need to convert those data into an equation, and to do that, we will use linear regression.\nThere are literally dozens of choices of software that will estimate the demand curve equation from price-quantity data. This book gives a detailed explanation of the process using three common analytics platforms: spreadsheet, R, and Python. Depending on your skills and preferences, choose your preferred platform and learn the details about using that platform for estimating the demand curve through regression. In this chapter, we will remain neutral about the estimation platform and invite it to you to explore the particulars of your preferred platform in the supplementary documents dedicated to your platform. For example, throughout this book on entrepreneurship analytics, we will study the expected profitability of Muscle Cola, a hypothetical protein infused soft drink that provides protein replenishment and refreshment after a workout.\nAt this stage, we will just report the demand estimation of the data collected and reported above and consider how to interpret the regression results as the demand equation. While regression results are reported differently by different analytics platforms, they all have the same components: the regression estimates of the variable coefficients, standard errors of the estimated coefficients, t-statistics for the estimated coefficients, and a variety of measures of the goodness of the statistical fit.\nLet’s dig into the regression results for the quantity demanded of a durable good as a function of price. The data for this regression model were presented in Table 4.3. There, willingness to pay (wtp) serves as a proxy for the independent, predictor variable of price. Changes in the dependent variable quantity are caused by changes in price. We use linear regression as a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. In a linear relationship, one variable changes at a constant rate relative to another \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 x}\\). This relationship can be visualized through a straight line when the data is plotted on a graph, hence the term “linear.”\nLet’s start our analysis of the demand curve by visualizing of the relationship between our dependent variable quantity and our independent variable wtp in a scatterplot. This scatterplot is shown in Figure 4.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Scatterplot of the relationship between price and quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, the relationship looks linear and the impact of wtp on quantity seems clear and strongly negative as we would expect.\n\nUse Linear Regression Analysis\nUsing regression, we can get the specific linear equation of the relationship between price and quantity sold.  Linear regression is employed to fit linear models to datasets, enabling the analysis of the relationship between two or more variables by choosing coefficients that minimize the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.\nModel Interpretation: The summary of the linear model gives details about the coefficients of the equation, error estimates, and other statistical measures. Interpreting the summary of a linear regression model involves evaluating various statistical metrics to understand the model’s performance and validity. Here are the key components:\n\nEstimate: These are the estimated coefficients of the model. In the context of a simple linear regression model \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1\\ x_1}\\), \\(\\mathsf{b_0}\\) is the y-intercept (the value of \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) when \\(\\mathsf{x = 0}\\)), and \\(\\mathsf{b_1}\\) is the slope, indicating the change in \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) for a one-unit change in \\(\\mathsf{x}\\).\nStd. Error: This measures the variability in the estimate for the coefficient. Lower values indicate more reliable estimates.\nt value: It’s the coefficient divided by its standard error. It tests the hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero (no effect). A t-value of 2 would indicate that the coefficient is two standard errors away from 0.\nPr(&gt;|t|) or p-value: A low p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero.\n\nIn other words, a low p-value gives you confidence that the relationship between \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) is not just random correlation.\n\nIn fact, the p-value can be interpreted as the level of confidence you can have: p = 0.05 means that there is only a five percent chance that the relationship is actually random rather than a meaningful relationship where \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) is influencing \\(\\mathsf{y}\\).\n\nWe typically say that we have 95 percent confidence about the estimate in this case.\nTechnically, this means that if we repeated the data collection and estimation 100 times, we would expect that in five of the 100 cases our estimate would actually be zero rather than the estimated coefficient.\n\n\nIn addition to examining individual coefficients, understanding the overall fit of a linear regression model is crucial. The summary of a linear regression model provides essential statistics to assess the model’s performance and validity. Here are key components related to the overall model fit:\n\nR-squared: R-squared is a measure of how well the independent variables explain the variability in the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.\n\nAn R-squared value of 0.0 indicates that the model explains none of the variance, while an R-squared of 1.0 means that the model explains all of the variance.\nFor example, if R-squared is 0.80, it suggests that 80% of the variance in the dependent variable can be attributed to the independent variables included in the model.\nR-squared is often interpreted as the goodness of fit, where higher values indicate a better fit.\n\nF-statistic: The F-statistic assesses the overall significance of the regression model. It tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients in the model are equal to zero, meaning that the independent variables have no effect on the dependent variable.\n\nA high F-statistic indicates that the model as a whole is statistically significant, meaning that at least one of the independent variables is contributing significantly to explaining the variance in the dependent variable.\nThe F-statistic is associated with a p-value (typically ≤ 0.05), and a low p-value suggests that the model is statistically significant.\nIf the F-statistic is significant, it implies that the regression equation, as a whole, provides meaningful information about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n\n\nIn summary, R-squared provides insight into how well the independent variables collectively explain the variation in the dependent variable. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit. The F-statistic and its associated p-value evaluate whether the model, as a whole, is statistically significant. If the p-value is low, it suggests that the model is meaningful and provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variables.\n\n\nEstimating Demand for the Willingness to Pay Data\nConsider the output from the regression of our transformed data on quantity and price, using the lm function from R.\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = quantity ~ wtp, data = wtp_q_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.9395 -1.6873 -0.3017  1.8244  3.5091 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept) 25.04943    1.18871   21.07 3.05e-10 ***\nwtp         -0.78739    0.06062  -12.99 5.13e-08 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 2.222 on 11 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.9388,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.9332 \nF-statistic: 168.7 on 1 and 11 DF,  p-value: 5.13e-08\n\n\n\n#install.packages(\"gtsummary\")\n#library(gtsummary)\n#tbl_regression(demand_model, intercept=T)\n\nModel Interpretation:\n\nIn terms of overall model fit, we see that the F-statistic of 168.7384997 is significantly different from zero meaning that the model fits well. The R-squared value is 0.9388 meaning that we are explaining 93.88 percent of the variance of quantity. Given the variance we saw in the plot, it is not surprising that the R-squared is not terribly high.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -12.9899384 and a p-value of 5.1295431^{-8} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated demand curve for the durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{Q = 25.0494315 -0.7873875 P} \\] where wtp serves as a proxy for price. In simple terms, this demand curve suggests that for every $1.00 increase in the price of the durable good, the quantity demanded in the sample of respondents decreases by 0.7874 units of the product.\nVisually and empirically we can see that the relationship is linear, meaning that it has the form \\(\\mathsf{y = mx + b}\\) or, more commonly analytics, \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 \\ x}\\). Not all data exhibit this clear linear relationship and we will address how to estimate nonlinear relationships later.\n\nFor a visual representation of the demand data and the estimated demand curve, refer to Figure 5.2. Based on the estimated coefficients and the robust goodness-of-fit statistics, we have confidence that the demand curve accurately represents the behavior of consumers. By sampling actual customers and asking relevant questions about their willingness to pay for this durable good, we have obtained a reliable estimate of the demand curve, which serves as a crucial element in constructing the profit function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Demand data and estimated demand curve.",

    "text": "4.5 Conclusion\nIn the world of evidence-based entrepreneurship, we don’t rely on guesswork; we use judgment rooted in evidence to guide our decisions and actions. This shift from guesswork to informed judgment involves crafting hypotheses and testing them through experiments. Ultimately, all these tests revolve around a fundamental question: Is our innovation viable?\nThe litmus test for viability lies in customer validation. If customers confirm that they have a problem and believe our solution can solve it, they’re more likely to buy. This is the essence of demand. Moreover, not all customers are created equal. Some may prefer our solution more than others, leading to variations in demand. Additionally, the channel through which we sell our product or service can significantly impact demand.\nWhile traditional business model validation tests may not explicitly estimate the demand curve, they help us understand if the demand curve exists, and if so, its strength.\nOne of the most robust ways to gauge the viability of an innovation is by calculating its expected profitability using evidence gathered from customers. In the early stages of testing, we focus on validation tests to ascertain if any demand for the solution exists. As we progress and the solution evolves, we transition to calculating expected profits, leveraging the evidence at hand. Customer demand serves as the cornerstone of profitability calculations. Once we accurately estimate the demand curve, it becomes our compass for navigating the intricacies of revenue, cost, and ultimately, profitability.\nIn seeking evidence for the key decisions in a startup, demand isn’t just a concept; it’s the catalyst that enables us to predict the decisions that lead to success.",

    "text": "4.6 Workout Problems\n\nDorsal Packs\nAfter receiving warnings about the risks of pickpockets when traveling to international tourist destinations, a group of entrepreneurs compared notes about their international travel experiences. They found that they had all experienced some anxiety about their own safety and the security of their belongings in popular tourist destinations. More importantly, they had all taken some steps to try to protect against pickpockets and thieves.\nTo confirm their personal experiences, they talked with many others who had also traveled to tourist destinations. They confirmed that thieves are active in those places and that even travelers who had not lost possessions suffered anxiety about the risk and took steps to protect their belongings. One common problem that came up in those discussions is that the zippers that make our bags simultaneously accessible and secure also make our bags accessible to thieves. An experienced pickpocket can unzip a backpack, take its contents, and flee before the wearer notices. Possessions are also lost when a thief slashes the fabric at the bottom of a backpack with a razor, opening new access to the contents.\nThe team responded by creating the Dorsal travel pack. It is a stylish, modern backpack with all of the zippers facing inward toward the wearer’s back. It is made of slash resistant fabric in nondescript colors to avoid the attention that more popular colorful brands draw. The team went through a series of validation tests to confirm the pain and confirm the solution. The tests also helped the team refine the concept to meet the needs of their targeted travelers. The team also confirmed that they can sell the pack directly from their website.\nOne of the final tests was to analyze the expected profitability of the travel pack. The team reached out to members of their social networks and invited those who had recently traveled or were planning to travel in the near future to help. They were able to get 107 responses from potential customers who had traveled or were about to travel internationally. The respondents were shown the backpack and its features.

    "section": "4.7 Appendix: Elasticity of Demand",
    "text": "4.7 Appendix: Elasticity of Demand\nIt is traditional, when learning about demand curves, to turn our attention to the sensitivity of customers as measured by the elasticity of demand. Since customers provide the flow of funds that ultimately finance all of the activities in the firm, they are critical to performance. If customers are unwilling to pay, there is no hope for a competitive advantage to generate superior performance. The rate at which quantity demanded falls as price rises is the slope of the demand curve and defines how sensitive consumers are to changes in prices. Customers who are sensitive to prices will demand price cuts and resist our attempts to raise prices by buying the solutions of others. Price sensitivity can guide you in choosing solutions where customers are less sensitive to prices in addition to assisting in pricing decisions.\nMeasures of price sensitivity are complicated by their reliance on the unit of measurement. For example, if I say that the price of gasoline fell by 1, you immediately wonder if I mean $1 or 1 cent. Pennies versus dollars is an important difference of units of money. If I say that price fell by $1.00, you may be tempted to run out and fill your tank. However, your next question should be, “Price fell by $1.00 per what?” If it is $1.00 off from 1000 gallons, it is not so attractive. Units matter. To resolve the problem of units, economists express sensitivity to price in terms of percentage changes. This sensitivity measure is independent of units and is called elasticity. The sensitivity of the changes is expressed as a percentage change in the one thing leading to some percentage change in the other thing.\nThe traditional measure of price sensitivity is the own-price elasticity of demand which reveals the percentage change in quantity demanded that results from a one percent change in price.1 The method to calculate the own-price elasticity of demand using calculus is\n\\[\n   \\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_x,P_x} =  \\frac{d Q_{x}}{d P_{x}} \\cdot \\frac{P_{x}}{Q_{x}} }\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon\\), the Greek letter “epsilon” is used to denote elasticity, \\(\\mathsf{Q_x}\\) is quantity demanded of product \\(\\mathsf{x}\\), \\(\\mathsf{P_x}\\) is the price of \\(\\mathsf{x}\\), and \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{dQ_{x}}{dP_{x}}}\\) is the derivative (slope) of the demand curve.\nTo characterize a customer’s sensitivity to price we compare the absolute value of elasticity to one. When \\(|\\epsilon| &gt;1\\), demand is elastic; when \\(| \\epsilon| &lt;1\\), demand is inelastic; when \\(| \\epsilon| =1\\), demand is unitary elastic. These labels reflect the size of the response in quantity demanded to a change in price. When you know the elasticity of demand, you know how consumption and revenue will change in response to a change in price. When the own-price elasticity of demand, in absolute value, is greater than one, revenue will rise when you lower the price. The fact that demand is elastic means that a one percent reduction in price will lead to more than a one percent increase in consumption. Since quantity goes up more than price goes down, revenue will rise. By the same logic and math, when the elasticity of demand is inelastic, revenue rises when price is increased because a one percent increase in price will result in less than a one percent reduction in quantity demanded.\nCalculating percentage changes is straightforward by simply finding the difference between the new value and the original value and dividing by the original value. For example, if a price went from $50 to $55, the percentage change is \\[\n  \\mathsf{ \\dfrac{P_{1}-P_{0}}{P_{0}} = \\dfrac{55-50}{50} = 0.1}\n\\] or in words, a 10% increase in price. We find the elasticity of one variable with respect to another by dividing the percentage change in the first variable by the percentage change in the second.\nThe own-price elasticity of demand shows us how sensitive customers of \\(\\mathsf{X}\\) are to changes in the price of \\(\\mathsf{X}\\). We call it the “own-price elasticity of demand” to distinguish it from the influence of prices of other goods. We call their influence the “cross-price elasticity of demand.” If the price of \\(\\mathsf{X}\\) is increased by one percent, by what percent do customers decrease their quantity demanded of \\(\\mathsf{X}\\)? This is the own-price elasticity of demand and it is expressed mathematically as \\[\\begin{align}\n   \\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_x,P_x}} & = \\mathsf{\\dfrac{\\%\\Delta Q_x }{\\%\\Delta P_x }\n    = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{Q_1-Q_0}{Q_0}}{\\dfrac{P_1-P_0}{P_0}}\n    = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\Delta Q_{x}}{Q_0}}{\\dfrac{\\Delta P_{x}}{P_0}}\n    = \\dfrac{\\Delta Q_{x}}{Q_{0}}\\dfrac{P_{0}}{\\Delta P_{x}}} \\notag \\\\\n   &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{\\Delta Q_{x}}{\\Delta P_{x}} \\cdot \\dfrac{P_{0}}{Q_{0}}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathsf{\\Delta}\\) signifies a change. Notice that the first part of the elasticity formula is the slope of the demand curve. Remember that slope is the rise of a function divided by its run. The change in quantity is the “rise” of the demand curve and the change in price is the “run.” Therefore, \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{\\Delta Q_{x}}{\\Delta P_{x}}}\\) is the rise over the run (slope) of the demand curve. In short, the own-price elasticity of demand is the slope of the demand curve multiplied by price over quantity.\nIf we let the changes in price become infinitely small they become the derivative of quantity with respect to price and the elasticity equation becomes the more useful calculus version of elasticity:\n\\[\n   \\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_x,P_x} =  \\dfrac{d Q_{x}}{d P_{x}} \\cdot \\dfrac{P_{x}}{Q_{x}}}\n\\] where \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{dQ_{x}}{dP_{x}}}\\) is the derivative (slope) of the demand curve.2 The elasticity is a number that we interpret, in words, as a one percent change in price of \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) causing a \\(\\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_x,P_x}}\\) percent change in quantity demanded. More specifically, if the own-price elasticity is \\(\\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_x,P_x} = -0.5}\\), we say that a one percent increase in price leads to a 0.5 percent decrease in quantity demanded.\nConsider a rubber band. If a force is applied and the rubber band stretches a long way, it is more elastic than a rubber band that stretches less. Similarly, when the force of a one percent increase in price is applied to a customer, that customer’s demand is elastic when the customer reduces consumption by more than one percent. When a one percent price hike is presented to an inelastic customer, the customer reduces quantity demand by less than one percent. When the customer is unitary elastic, a one percent increase in price results in a one percent reduction in quantity demanded.\nA customer’s sensitivity to price is influenced by several factors. In general, anything that shifts the intercept or the slope of the demand curve will also change the elasticity at a particular price. For example, if concerns about the health effects of saturated fat reduce the demand for cheese, customers’ demand will also be more elastic at the historical price. Logically, this is because the health concerns will exacerbate the reductions in consumption when price is raised. Mathematically, customers become more elastic (elasticity becomes a larger negative number) because the quantity in the denominator falls while the slope and price stay the same. Time will also change elasticity. In the short-run, we have fewer substitutes and are therefore more inelastic. Similarly, we are more inelastic about consuming categories of goods than consuming specific goods. For example, demand for New Balance running shoes is much more elastic than for clothing in general.\n\nElasticity with Linear Demand Curves\nNow let’s look at the relationship between elasticity and the demand curve. From the elasticity equation, we can see that the own-price elasticity of any demand curve is the slope of the demand curve multiplied by \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{P}{Q}}\\). This means that the elasticity is proportional to the slope of the demand curve but not the same thing as the slope. As the ratio of price and quantity changes while moving along the demand curve, the elasticity also changes. If the slope of the demand curve is -2 at every point on the curve but the elasticity differs along the curve because the ratio of price and quantity is changing.\nFor example, at a price of $250, the elasticity is very different from the elasticity at a price of $750.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_x= 1500,P_x = 250}} &= \\mathsf{-2 \\frac{250}{1500}} &  \\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_{x} =500,P_{x}=750}} &= \\mathsf{-2 \\cdot \\dfrac{750}{500}} \\\\\n                                          &= -0.3333                      &                                           &= -3.0\n\\end{align}\\] When the demand curve becomes steeper, the slope (derivative) becomes a larger negative number and demand becomes more elastic.\nElasticity does not only pertain to the sensitivity of customers of a good. The sensitivity of any relationship where one thing causes another can be characterized by an elasticity. As we have seen, demand curves depend on many things besides the price of the good. For example, the demand curve \\(\\mathsf{Q_{x}(P_{x}) = a - bP_{x} + cP_{y} + dM}\\) implies that the price of \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\) and income (\\(\\mathsf{M}\\)) also determine demand for \\(\\mathsf{X}\\). The cross-price elasticity of demand between \\(\\mathsf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\) displays the sensitivity of demand for \\(\\mathsf{X}\\) to changes in the price of \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\). The cross-price elasticity is calculated in the same way as the own price elasticity with the appropriate substitution of \\(\\mathsf{P_{y}}\\) for \\(\\mathsf{P_{x}}\\):\n\\[\n  \\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_{x},P_{y}} = \\dfrac{dQ_{x}}{dP_{y}} \\cdot \\dfrac{P_{y}}{Q_{x}}.}\n\\]\nWhile the calculation of the cross-price elasticity of demand is the same as the own-price elasticity of demand, the interpretation of the elasticity is not. With the cross-price elasticity, we are looking at the sign to interpret its impact on demand. If the cross-price elasticity is positive, the good \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\) is a substitute for good \\(\\mathsf{X}\\). If the cross-price elasticity is positive it means that a one percent increase in the price of \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\) results in an increase in consumption of \\(\\mathsf{X}\\). We know from the law of demand that an increase in \\(\\mathsf{P_{y}}\\) results in a decrease in quantity demanded for \\(\\mathsf{Q_{y}}\\). If demand for \\(\\mathsf{X}\\) also increases, it must be because consumers that were consuming \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\) have begun consuming \\(\\mathsf{X}\\). That makes \\(\\mathsf{X}\\) a substitute for \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\). For example, sports drinks would be expected to be substitutes for cola and the cross-price elasticity should be positive.\nIf the cross-price elasticity is negative, the good \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\) is a complement of \\(\\mathsf{X}\\). If \\(\\mathsf{P_{y}}\\) increases, then \\(\\mathsf{Q_{y}}\\) decreases. If \\(\\mathsf{Q_{x}}\\) is also caused to decrease by the increase in \\(\\mathsf{P_{y}}\\), it must mean that customers stop consuming \\(\\mathsf{X}\\) when they stop consuming \\(\\mathsf{Y}\\). This usually means that the products are consumed together and they are complementary products. For example, products consumed together like cars and gasoline are complements. If demand for cars in China increases, demand for gasoline does too. If the world supply of gasoline remains constant, the increased demand drives up price. We may be quite inelastic with respect to gasoline prices but our cross-price elasticity for gas-guzzling cars is quite large. High gas prices cut gas consumption by a little and gas-guzzling car consumption by a lot.\n\n\nElasticity with Nonlinear (Exponential) Demand Curves\nThe basic formula for the own-price elasticity of demand, \\(\\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q_{x},P_{y}} = \\frac{dQ_{x}}{dP_{y}} \\cdot \\frac{P_{y}}{Q_{x}}}\\) is the same for linear and nonlinear demand curves alike. However, the slope (derivative) of nonlinear demand curves differs from linear demand curves so the specific formula for elasticity in nonlinear demand curves deserves attention.\nThe exponential demand curve has the form \\(\\mathsf{Q = ae^{-bP}}\\). The own-price elasticity of demand for this form is \\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{\\epsilon_{Q,P}} &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{dQ}{dP} \\cdot \\dfrac{P}{Q} = -bae^{-bP} \\cdot \\dfrac{P}{Q}} \\notag \\\\[9pt]\n                         &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{-bae^{-bP}P}{ae^{-bp}}} \\notag \\\\[9pt]\n                         &= \\mathsf{-bP}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis means that the own-price elasticity of the exponential demand curve is negative one when \\(\\mathsf{P= -\\frac{1}{b}}\\).",

    "text": "The own-price elasticity of demand is focused on the change of quantity demanded attributable to a change in the price of the product. In practice, we can find the elasticity of anything that causes another thing. For example, the cross-price elasticity of demand shows how demand changes as the price of another good changes and income elasticity of demand shows how demand changes as income changes.↩︎\nA brief review of derivatives may be useful. For a general function like \\(\\mathsf{y = bx^{n}}\\), the slope of the function is found through the derivative which is \\(\\mathsf{dy/dx = nbx^{n-1}}\\). In words, a derivative is taken by bringing down the exponent, multiplying it by the slope parameter, and reducing the exponent by one. Consider the following example. The demand curve can be written as \\(\\mathsf{Q = a - bP}\\) and can be equivalently written as \\(\\mathsf{Q = ax^{0} - bx^{1}}\\). The elasticity is the derivative times price divided by quantity. Taking the derivative of the demand curve we get \\(\\mathsf{dQ/dP = 0\\times a\\times x^{-1} -1\\times b\\times x^{0} = -b}\\). This means that the complete elasticity is $ $. For a more specific example, consider the demand curve \\(\\mathsf{Q_{x} = 1000 - 10P_{x}}\\). We can rewrite this as \\(\\mathsf{Q_{x} = 1000P_{x}^{0} - 10P_{x}^{1}}\\). The slope of the demand curve is the derivative. It is found by bringing down the exponent of each term to multiply it by the rest of the term and then subtracting one from the exponent as follows: \\(\\mathsf{dQ/dP = 0 \\times 100 \\times P_{x}^{-1} - 1 \\times 10 \\times P_{x}^{0} = -10}\\). The elasticity is \\(\\mathsf{\\epsilon = (dQ/dP) \\times (P/Q) = -10\\times P/Q}\\).↩︎",

    "text": "5.2 Gather Willingness to Pay Data\nUnderstanding the demand for durable goods requires a strategic approach to data collection. Due to the lasting nature of these goods, gauging customers’ willingness to pay becomes paramount. While the general principles of data collection remain constant, there are nuanced methods tailored to durable goods.\n\nContextual Introduction: Begin by setting the stage. Describe the product in detail, emphasizing its long-term benefits, durability, and how it stands apart from other similar products in the market. A well-painted picture helps potential customers visualize the product in their lives.\nSeek Genuine Feedback: Before diving into the monetary aspect, engage customers in a dialogue about the product.\n\nThe Wow Factor Test: Start by asking them to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 10. Don’t give them any conditions on what 1 or 10 means – that would only bias their responses. This initial interaction can serve as an icebreaker and provide invaluable feedback.\nOpen-Ended Queries: Encourage them to share what they like the most and least about the product. While many might skip these open-ended questions, it sends a clear message that you value their opinion.\nProduct Improvement: Ask for suggestions on how the product can be enhanced. Not only does this give you a perspective on areas of improvement, but it also makes the customer feel valued and engaged.\n\nPositioning the Willingness to Pay Question: Now that you’ve engaged the customer and cultivated a mindset of evaluation, you can segue into the pivotal question without it sounding opportunistic.\n\nSet the Tone: Preface the question by expressing genuine interest in their opinion. Mention that as entrepreneurs or students, you’re passionate about the product and genuinely need their help in shaping it further.\nThe Main Query: Then, frame the question: “Considering the features and benefits we’ve discussed, what is the most you would be willing to pay for this product?” By this point, the customer perceives this question as another form of rating the product, rather than feeling pressured into a commitment.\n\nData Documentation: Record their willingness to pay responses systematically, noting any additional feedback or comments that might accompany the figures. Over time, this will allow you to discern patterns and trends in consumer sentiment.\nAcknowledge and Appreciate: Thank your respondents for their time and insights. Let them know their feedback is instrumental in the evolution of the product.\n\nIn conclusion, for durable goods, gauging willingness to pay isn’t just about fetching a figure. It’s a blend of understanding perceptions, capturing genuine feedback, and making potential customers feel valued in the product’s journey. Approached with care and genuine interest, it becomes less about money and more about mutual value creation.\nAs an example, we have a relatively short survey of respondents who are representative of the target customers for an innovative product. The respondents were shown the product, engaged in a wow focus test, and then asked about the most they would be willing to pay for the durable good. The data set is named durable_good_data and has a variable named wow with the wow factor score awarded by each respondent (“Rate this product on a scale of 1 - 10”) and their willingness to pay.\nThe data are found in Table 5.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwow\nwtp\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.00\n\n\n8\n1.99\n\n\n7\n2.00\n\n\n8\n1.96\n\n\n8\n3.00\n\n\n1\n0.00\n\n\n4\n0.51\n\n\n10\n2.97\n\n\n10\n3.00\n\n\n5\n1.45\n\n\n7\n1.96\n\n\n3\n1.00\n\n\n1\n0.00\n\n\n8\n2.49\n\n\n1\n0.00\n\n\n10\n7.13\n\n\n10\n5.00\n\n\n5\n0.92\n\n\n10\n3.94\n\n\n8\n1.51\n\n\n10\n3.01\n\n\n9\n2.51\n\n\n10\n3.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Wow factor scores and willingness to pay data from a survey of 23 target customers.",

    "section": "5.3 Calculating Quantity for Durable Goods from Willingness to Pay Data",
    "text": "5.3 Calculating Quantity for Durable Goods from Willingness to Pay Data\nTo derive a demand curve from willingness to pay data for durable goods, we need to convert the data into a price-quantity relationship that aligns with the law of demand. Here’s a condensed step-by-step process:\n\nOrganize the Data: Arrange willingness to pay data and identify unique values.\nCount Responses: Quantify how many respondents are willing to pay at each unique price point.\nCalculate Cumulative Quantity: To adhere to the law of demand, ensure that a respondent willing to pay a higher price would also buy at a lower price. Starting from the highest price, accumulate the counts to reflect the total number of consumers willing to purchase at or below each price.\n\nLet’s work through the process of calculating quantity from the willingness to pay data in the durable_good_data tibble. We begin by getting a count of how many times each unique willingness to pay was named. The R codebase and output for this count are\n\n\nCode\ndurable_count &lt;- durable_good_data |&gt;\n  group_by(wtp) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n())\ndurable_count\n\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 2\n     wtp count\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1  0        4\n 2  0.51     1\n 3  0.92     1\n 4  1        1\n 5  1.45     1\n 6  1.51     1\n 7  1.96     2\n 8  1.99     1\n 9  2        1\n10  2.49     1\n11  2.51     1\n12  2.97     1\n13  3        2\n14  3.01     1\n15  3.41     1\n16  3.94     1\n17  5        1\n18  7.13     1\n\n\nNext we convert the count variable into a quantity variable that adheres to the law of demand by calculating a cumulative sum of the counts beginning with the highest willingness to pay. The R code and output of the calculation of quantity as a cumulative sum of count gives us:\n\n\nCode\ndurable_quantity &lt;- durable_count |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(wtp)) |&gt; \n  mutate(quantity = cumsum(count))\ndurable_quantity\n\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 3\n     wtp count quantity\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1  7.13     1        1\n 2  5        1        2\n 3  3.94     1        3\n 4  3.41     1        4\n 5  3.01     1        5\n 6  3        2        7\n 7  2.97     1        8\n 8  2.51     1        9\n 9  2.49     1       10\n10  2        1       11\n11  1.99     1       12\n12  1.96     2       14\n13  1.51     1       15\n14  1.45     1       16\n15  1        1       17\n16  0.92     1       18\n17  0.51     1       19\n18  0        4       23\n\n\n\nThis is more efficient to do in a single command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompting your AI for code to calculate quantity\n\n\n\nThe code we need to transform the willingness to pay variable into a quantity variable is not very intuitive for ChatGPT to understand.

    "text": "5.4 Estimate the Demand Curve\nArmed with the willingness to pay wtp and quantity, we are ready to estimate the demand curve for the durable good. The data are stored in a tibble named durable_quantity and the glimpse of the data is\n\n\nRows: 18\nColumns: 3\n$ wtp      &lt;dbl&gt; 7.13, 5.00, 3.94, 3.41, 3.01, 3.00, 2.97, 2.51, 2.49, 2.00, 1…\n$ count    &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4\n$ quantity &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23\n\n\nHere, wtp is willingness to pay which serves as a proxy for price and quantity is the dependent variable that is caused by changes in price.\nBefore regression of the price / quantity relationship, let’s visualize it in a scatterplot using ggplot.\n\n\nCode\n# Plotting the data\nggplot(data = durable_quantity, \n       aes(x=wtp, y=quantity)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x=\"Price\", y=\"Quantity\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Scatterplot visualization of the relatiionship between quantity and willingness to pay (price) data.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, the impact of wtp on quantity seems clear and strongly negative as we would expect. The shape of the relationship may be linear but there are strong hints of a nonlinear relationship. We will test that.\n\nEstimating the Linear Demand Curve\nFirst, let’s use the linear model function lm() from R to estimate the linear regression model of quantity and wtp assuming a linear relationship between the variables.\n\n\nCode\nlinear_demand_model &lt;- lm(data = durable_quantity, \n                       quantity ~ wtp)\nsummary(linear_demand_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = quantity ~ wtp, data = durable_quantity)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.9700 -1.6468 -0.2875  1.3799  6.3226 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The R-squared value is 0.8414 meaning that we are explaining 84.14 percent of the variance of quantity.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -9.2131961 and a p-value of 8.4833343^{-8} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated linear demand curve for the durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{Q = 19.4119 -3.4691 P} \\] where wtp serves as a proxy for price. In simple terms, this demand curve suggests that for every $1.00 increase in the price of the durable good, the quantity demanded across the sample of respondents decreases by 3.4691 units of the product.\nEmpirically we can see that there is a good fit of the linear model to the price / quantity data. Visualization throug a scatterplot suggests that we should consider a nonlinear relationship such as a negative exponential demand curve.\n\n\n\n\nEstimating the Exponential Demand Curve\nThe negative exponential demand curve has the form \\[\\mathsf{Q = a \\mbox{e}^{bP}}\\] where e is the base for the exponential function exp(). We cannot estimate this nonlinear relationship directly because all linear regression must have the form \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 x}\\) and the negative exponential relationship does not have this linear form.\n\nFortunately, we can transform the data to “linearize” it giving us a linear relationship. To linearize the data, we take the natural log (log() in R) of both sides of the demand curve giving us \\[\\mathsf{log(Q) =  \\alpha + b P}\\] where \\(\\mathsf{\\alpha = log(a)}\\). In words, we simply need to take the log of the dependent variable (y-variable) quantity and estimate the linear regression. The R code to do this and the output are\n\n\nCode\nexponential_demand_model &lt;- lm(log(quantity) ~ wtp, durable_quantity)\nsummary(exponential_demand_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(quantity) ~ wtp, data = durable_quantity)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.30389 -0.17734  0.05967  0.13747  0.26068 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)  3.34438    0.08022   41.69  &lt; 2e-16 ***\nwtp         -0.49286    0.02685  -18.36 3.58e-12 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 0.1883 on 16 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.9547,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.9518 \nF-statistic:   337 on 1 and 16 DF,  p-value: 3.575e-12\n\n\nExponential Model Interpretation:\n\nAfter linearization of the data, we have estimated the demand model as an exponential demand curve. Looking at the regression results, we must first recognize that we have the regression model of \\(\\mathsf{log(quantity)}\\) rather than the model of \\(\\mathsf{quantity}\\).\nIn terms of overall fit of the exponential model, we see that the F-statistic of 336.9507 is significantly different from zero meaning that the model fits well. The R-squared value is 0.9547 meaning that we are explaining 95.47 percent of the variance of quantity. The F-statistic and the R-squared values for the exponential model are both greater than their counterparts in the linear model. This suggests that the relationship is more likely to be exponential than linear.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -18.3562173 and a p-value of 3.5750384^{-12} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated linear demand curve for the durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{log(Q) = 3.3444 -0.4929 P} \\] or \\[ \\mathsf{Q = e^{3.3444 -0.4929 P}}\\] where wtp serves as a proxy for price.\nBecause it is an exponential demand curve, the interpretation is different. For every $1.00 increase in the price of the durable good, the logarithm of the quantity demanded across the sample of respondents decreases by 0.4929 units of the product. The change in logarithm of a value is not very intuitive to most of us.\n\n\n\nTest to Choose between the Linear Demand and Exponential Demand Models\nThe linear model and the exponential model are not directly comparable because one is the linear model of \\(\\mathsf{quantity}\\) and the other is the linear model of \\(\\mathsf{log(quantity)}\\). In general, comparing the F-statistics and the R-squared values of the two models gives us a pretty clear picture of which model is better for the data. However, it is not the best comparison.\nThe “Akaike Information Criterion” (AIC) is a single number that encapsulates the quality of each model in its entirety. It takes into consideration how well the model fits the data (like R-squared) and the simplicity of the model (we prefer simpler models because they’re easier to understand and less prone to errors). The model with the lowest AIC is often considered the best choice, as it represents the best balance between fitting our data well and being straightforward.\nLet’s compare the linear demand model with the exponential demand model based on their AIC scores.\n\n\nCode\n# Compare the AIC values for the two models\n(aic_linear &lt;- AIC(linear_demand_model))\n\n\n[1] 89.90966\n\n\nCode\n(aic_exponential &lt;- AIC(exponential_demand_model))\n\n\n[1] -5.157227\n\n\nThe AIC score for the linear demand model is 89.9096587 and the AIC score for the exponential demand model is -5.1572273. Since the AIC score of the exponential demand model is much lower than from the linear demand model, we conclude that the demand curve is indeed exponential and choose that regression model results.",

    "text": "6.1 Non-durable Goods\nIn the world of entrepreneurial analytics, understanding customer demand is a pivotal factor. In the previous chapter, we explored the intricacies of durable goods. Now, let’s dive into non-durable goods, another commonly-encountered dimension of demand analysis in startups.\nNon-durable goods are products that are typically consumed in a single use, such as food, toiletries, or movie tickets. These items are characterized by their transient nature and limited lifespan. Unlike durable goods that last for an extended period, non-durable goods are usually exhausted after one use. As a result, we normally expect that consumers will purchase more than one unit per period.\nIt is important to treat non-durable goods correctly because treating them like durable goods and asking only about consumer’s willingness to pay overlooks the multiple units that each consumer intends to purchase.\nExamples of Non-durable Goods:\nTo effectively analyze non-durable goods demand, it’s crucial to gather both price and quantity data. Unlike durable goods, where consumers typically buy one unit for an extended period, non-durable goods often involve repeat purchases within a given time frame. Therefore, understanding how price influences the quantity that individual consumers intend to purchase is essential for informed decision-making in entrepreneurial ventures.\nThe primary approach to collect price-quantity data for non-durable goods is to ask potential customers how many they will purchase at a series of prices, .e.g., $10, $20, etc. You name the price and they name the quantity giving us the price-quantity we need to estimate their demand model. The major drawback is that you will be asking many similar questions. If you ask too many, your respondents will suffer survey fatigue and stop answering.",

    "section": "6.2 Quantity Data at Various Prices",
    "text": "6.2 Quantity Data at Various Prices\n\nGathering Price-Quantity Data\nCollecting data about how many units potential customers would purchase at various prices is a vital step in understanding demand for non-durable goods. However, the way you approach and interact with potential customers during this data collection process can significantly impact the quality of insights you gather.\nHere are some essential tips for effectively interacting with potential customers:\n\nSet the Context: Begin your conversation by providing context about the non-durable good. Explain its unique features, benefits, and how it addresses specific needs or problems. Help potential customers visualize how the product fits into their lives.\nEngage in a Dialogue: Before jumping into questions about pricing, engage customers in a conversation about the product.\n\nThe Wow Factor Test: Start by asking them to rate their initial impression of the product on a scale of 1 to 10, without predefined meanings for 1 or 10. This not only breaks the ice but also provides valuable feedback.\nOpen-Ended Queries: Encourage customers to share what they like the most and least about the product. These open-ended questions can uncover insights you might have missed.\nSeek Suggestions: Ask for suggestions on how the product could better meet their needs. This not only provides improvement ideas but also makes customers feel valued and engaged in the product’s development.\n\nIntroduce the Pricing Question Thoughtfully: When transitioning to the question about how many units they would purchase at different prices, do so thoughtfully.\n\nExpress Genuine Interest: Preface the pricing question by expressing genuine interest in their opinions. Explain that you’re passionate about the product’s potential and sincerely value their input.\nFrame the Question: Phrase the pricing question as an extension of their evaluation: “Given the product’s features and benefits we’ve discussed, at a price of $3, how many units would you buy?” “At a price of $3.50, how many units would you buy?” and so on. This framing makes it feel like another aspect of rating the product rather than a commitment.\n\nSystematic Data Recording: Ensure that you systematically record the responses to willingness-to-pay questions, along with any additional feedback or comments provided by customers. This documentation will help you identify trends and patterns in consumer sentiment over time.\nShow Appreciation: Always express gratitude for their time and insights. Let customers know that their feedback plays a vital role in shaping the product and its journey.\n\nIn summary, gathering data about how customers would respond to various prices for non-durable goods is not just about numbers; it’s about creating a meaningful dialogue, understanding perceptions, and making potential customers feel valued in the product development process. When approached with care and genuine interest, this interaction becomes a valuable part of the journey towards mutual value creation.\nTable 6.1 provides a small sample of demand data using this approach where 23 potential target customers were asked the quantity they were willing to purchase at every price in a series. The data are in a tibble named pq_data and here is a glimpse() of that data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n$0.00\n$0.50\n$1.00\n$1.50\n$2.00\n$2.50\n3.00\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n5\n4\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n4\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n10\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n10\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n6\n5\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n2\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n2\n2\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n4\n4\n4\n4\n3\n3\n2\n\n\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n8\n2\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nQuantity (total)\n81.00\n44.00\n28.00\n21.00\n13.00\n7.00\n6.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Quantity demanded by the sample as the sum of quantity demanded of each respondent at various named prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Price-Quantity Variables\nQuantity data usually come survey platforms in the format we see in Table 6.1. We ask how many they would buy at $0.00, $1.00, etc and the survey platform sets up each price as a column for responses. Unfortunately, this data format is not tidy.\nHaving tidy data means that every column is a variable and every row is an observation. The columns of this data are for each price in the series we named. In other words, they are values of an underlying price variable rather than different variables. We really ony have have two variables here, price and the quantity the respondent would buy at that price. To tidy the data, we use R’s pivot_longer() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructing your AI prompt:\n\n\n\nThe pivot_longer() code we need is not very intuitive for your AI to understand. In other words, the prompt you give it needs to be very specific or it will give you code that does something different from what you need. I recommend laying it out as a list. If you edit the following to match the particulars of your data, it should work reliably.\nTo transform your data using pivot_longer(), follow these detailed steps:\n\nProvide a Glimpse of Your Tibble: Run the glimpse() function on your data and share the output with your AI. Use this format:\n“Here is a glimpse of my data:”\n(Then paste the output of glimpse(your_tibble_name))\nSpecify Columns for Transformation: Clearly state which columns you need to transform. For instance:\n“I want to use pivot_longer() on columns q_p_050 to q_p_250.”\nDefine New Column Names:\n“The values from these columns should be placed in a new column named quantity.”\n“The names of these columns should become values in a new column named price.”\nProvide Column Name to Value Conversion: Explain how column names should be converted to values:\n“For the conversion, q_p_050 should become 0.50, q_p_100 should become 1.00, and so on.”\n\n\n\nAfter receiving the code:\n\nVerify Column Count: Ensure you have the correct number of columns. You should see two new columns (price and quantity), and the original columns in the specified range should be gone.\nVerify Row Count: The number of rows in the transformed tibble should equal the number of original price values multiplied by the rows in the original tibble.\n\nThis structured approach will help AI provide you with the most accurate code for your requirements.\nHere is the text of a sample prompt that can be edited, copied, and pasted directly into your AI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI prompt for calculating price and quantity\n\n\n\n“Here is a glimpse(tb) … Please provide the tidyverse code to pivot_longer() on the columns q_p_050 to q_p_250 where the column values should be named quantity and the column names are the values of a variable named price. Note that the column names need to be converted to values q_p_050 = 0.50, q_p_100 = 1.00, etc.”\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Assuming your data frame is named pq_data\npq_long &lt;- pq_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), \n               names_to = \"price\", \n               values_to = \"quantity\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(price = parse_number(gsub(\"\\\\$\", \"\", price)))\n\n\n?tbl-wtp-q-data provides 10 rows out of the 161 rows of the tidy demand data where every row is the quantity that an individual respondent would buy at the named price. The tibble is made longer to have 161 rows because the data are pivoted to show 7 rows (one for each price) for every one of the 23 respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprice\nquantity\n\n\n\n\n0.0\n10\n\n\n0.5\n5\n\n\n1.0\n4\n\n\n1.5\n2\n\n\n2.0\n2\n\n\n2.5\n1\n\n\n3.0\n1\n\n\n0.0\n1\n\n\n0.5\n0\n\n\n1.0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.2: Tidy data of the quantities that would be purchased at every price by every respondent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate the Demand Curve\nThe data in the new tibble pq_long are tidy because we have one column for each of price and quantity and every row is an observation of the quantity purchased at each price by each respondent.\nNow lets visualize the relationship:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Visualization of the price quantity relationship of a non-durable good.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variance in the data at every named price makes it more difficult to verify that the data are linear but the impact of price on quantity quantity is clearly negative. We can use linear regression to estimate the model and evaluate the relationship between price and quantity.\n\nEstimation of the Linear Demand Curve\nLet’s first estimate the relationship as linear and then test for a nonlinear demand curve with the demand regression\n\n\nCode\nlinear_demand_model &lt;- lm(quantity ~ price, pq_long)\nsummary(linear_demand_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = quantity ~ price, data = pq_long)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.2174 -0.7547 -0.2671  0.2950  7.2950 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The R-squared value is 0.2746 meaning that we are explaining 27.46 percent of the variance of quantity. Given the variance we saw in the plot, it is not surprising that the R-squared is not terribly high.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -7.7580223 and a p-value of 9.7873694^{-13} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated demand curve for the non-durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{Q = 2.7049689 -0.9751553 P} \\] for each potential customer. This demand curve suggests that for every $1.00 increase in the price of the non-durable good, the quantity demanded decreases by 0.9752 units of the product per person.\nVisually, it was not clear that the relationship is linear. Not all data exhibit this clear linear relationship so let’s examine it.\n\n\n\nEstimation of the Nonlinear (exponential) Demand Curve\nIn some cases, the demand relationship for non-durable goods follows a nonlinear exponential form, which has the mathematical structure:\n\\[\\mathsf{Q = a \\cdot e^{bP}}\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathsf{e}\\) represents the base for the exponential function (usually computed using exp() in R). Unfortunately, we cannot estimate this nonlinear relationship directly because traditional linear regression assumes the form \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 x}\\), which the exponential demand curve does not conform to.\nHowever, there’s good news! We can transform the data to “linearize” it, making it possible to estimate a linear relationship. To linearize the data, we take the natural logarithm (using log() in R) of both sides of the demand curve equation, resulting in:\n\\[\\mathsf{log(Q) =  \\alpha + bP}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathsf{\\alpha = log(a)}\\). In simpler terms, we log-transform the dependent variable (quantity) and then proceed to estimate a linear regression.\nHere’s the R code to estimate the nonlinear exponential demand curve and the corresponding output:\n\n\nCode\nexponential_demand_model &lt;- lm(log(quantity + 1) ~ price, pq_long)\nsummary(exponential_demand_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(quantity + 1) ~ price, data = pq_long)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.95245 -0.39162 -0.04079  0.33310  1.25850 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Notice that because the quantity variable has a minimum value of 0, the log of quantity at the value is not defined so we had to add one (log(quantity + 1)) to be able to run the regression. This means that the regression model is based on \\(\\mathsf{log(quantity + 1)}\\), not directly on \\(\\mathsf{quantity}\\).\nAssessing the goodness of fit, observe that the F-statistic of 86.3706 is significantly different from zero meaning that the model fits well. The R-squared value is 0.352 meaning that we are explaining 35.2 percent of the variance of quantity, implying that the exponential model captures more variation in the data compared to a linear model.\nRegarding the impact of price on quantity, the estimated coefficient for price is negative, in accordance with the law of demand. This coefficient is significantly different from zero, as indicated by the t-value (t-value) and the p-value (p-value), which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated nonlinear exponential demand curve for non-durable goods can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\mathsf{log(Q + 1) = 1.1394 -0.3739 P}\n\\] or \\[\n\\mathsf{Q = e^{1.1394  -0.3739 P} - 1}\n\\] where wtp represents a proxy for price.\nInterpreting the exponential demand curve, for every $1.00 increase in the price of the non-durable good, the logarithm of the quantity demanded across the sample of respondents decreases by 0.3739 units of the product. It’s important to note that interpreting changes in the logarithm of a value may not be intuitive to most individuals.\nThis methodology enables us to estimate the demand curve for non-durable goods and understand how price influences consumer behavior in this context.",

    "section": "6.3 Aggregate Quantity Data at Various Prices",
    "text": "6.3 Aggregate Quantity Data at Various Prices\nIn Section 6.2, we gathered and tidied quantity data provided in response to a series of prices. As we saw the resulting demand curve predicts demand for an individual customer. In Section 4.4.2, we gathered willingness to pay and quantity data that led us to a demand curve for the collective sample of respondents rather than individual respondents.\nIn this section, we will explore how to transition from individual demand curves, represented by price-quantity data for each respondent, to aggregated demand curves that reflect the preferences of the entire sample.\n\nUnderstanding the Transition\nTo begin, let’s briefly clarify the difference between individual and aggregated demand curves:\n\nIndividual Demand Curves: These curves represent the demand behavior of individual consumers. Each respondent’s willingness to pay and corresponding quantity data form a unique demand curve. They provide insights into the preferences of specific consumers.\nAggregated Demand Curves: These curves reflect the combined demand patterns of the entire sample of respondents. They result from aggregating the individual demand data to create a collective representation of demand behavior. These curves aim to capture overall market trends.\n\n\n\nAggregating the Data\n\nGrouping by Price: To aggregate the individual demand data, we start by grouping the data by price. This process consolidates responses at each price point.\nSummarizing Quantity: Next, we summarize the data by calculating the total quantity demanded at each price level. This aggregation process transforms the individual quantity data into collective demand figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt your AI for code for aggregation\n\n\n\nThis is one of those requests that can cause chatGPT to generate many different commands. That means our prompts are often too ambiguous. Here is a template prompt that you can edit and paste into ChatGPT to get the code you need. The key is tell it the tibble name (call it a tibble and you will signal that you want tidyverse code or ask for tidyverse code directly), the price and quantity variables and ask it to aggregate the quantity variable for every price.\n“I have a tibble tb with price and quantity variables. I want to aggregate the quantity variable for every price.”\n\n\nHere’s the R code to achieve this aggregation:\n\n\nCode\n# Grouping data by price and summarizing quantity\naggregated_pq_data &lt;- pq_long |&gt;\n  group_by(price) |&gt;\n  summarise(Q = sum(quantity))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprice\nQ\n\n\n\n\n0.0\n81\n\n\n0.5\n44\n\n\n1.0\n28\n\n\n1.5\n21\n\n\n2.0\n13\n\n\n2.5\n7\n\n\n3.0\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.3: Price and quantity data aggregated for the sample of 23 respondents.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that aggregation has reduced the data to just seven rows – one for each price we named when collecting data from the respondents. This reduction is unavoidable and usually leaves us with relatively small datasets. The more prices we name during data collection, the greater the bias from survey fatigue.\n\n\nEstimate the Aggregated Demand Curve\nFirst, let’s visualize the aggregated demand data with a scatterplot to gain insights into the overall demand trend. We’ll then proceed to estimate both a linear and exponential demand curve to assess potential nonlinearity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Scatterplot of the relationship between aggregated price and quantity data for the sample or resondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot in Figure 6.2 shows the same negative relationship in the aggregated data that we saw in the individual data in Figure 6.1 but with less variance. The nonlinear relationship is more pronounced in the aggregated data as well.\n\n\nEstimate the Linear Aggregate Demand\nWe’ll start by estimating a linear demand curve for the aggregated data using regression analysis.\n\n\nCode\naggregate_linear_model &lt;- lm(Q ~ price, aggregated_pq_data)\nsummary(aggregate_linear_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Q ~ price, data = aggregated_pq_data)\n\nResiduals:\n       1        2        3        4        5        6        7 \n 18.7857  -7.0000 -11.7857  -7.5714  -4.3571   0.8571  11.0714 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "8.1 Economies of Scale\nThe cost structure of a company is shaped fundamentally by strategic decisions regarding what to produce in-house and what to procure from external sources. Opting to purchase inputs typically diminishes our fixed costs but can result in a higher variable cost per unit. Conversely, choosing to manufacture goods internally may elevate fixed costs but often leads to a decrease in variable costs per unit. As a firm invests in infrastructure and decides on its mix of make-or-buy, its cost structure inevitably evolves. Beyond these structural decisions, other influential forces dynamically shape costs. Chief among these are two pivotal concepts: economies of scale and the learning curve. Each plays a crucial role in the evolution of a firm’s cost profile over time and, if leveraged astutely, can endow a strategic advantage.\nEconomies of scale refer to the cost advantage that arises with increased output. The basic premise is simple: as production scales up, the average total cost (ATC) of each unit declines. This happens due to the spreading of fixed costs over a larger number of units and the potential for increased operational efficiency that larger production volumes can afford. For a start-up or a growing business, recognizing the point where economies of scale kick in can mean the difference between thriving and merely surviving.\nOn the other hand, the learning curve concept deals with unit cost dynamics as a function of cumulative production experience. It’s grounded in the observation that work becomes more efficient over time. The more often a task is performed, the lower the time and cost to complete future units becomes. This phenomenon can lead to significant cost reductions and is independent of the scale of operations, although it often complements economies of scale.\nTogether, these concepts describe the cost dynamics that are central to the strategic decision-making of an entrepreneur. They underscore the importance of production planning, workforce training, and technological investment. Balancing the immediate costs of expansion and training against long-term cost savings is a delicate act but one that can lead to a sustained competitive advantage. The ensuing sections will delve deeper into how these dynamics operate, their underlying principles, and how entrepreneurs can harness them to build efficient, cost-effective businesses.",

    "text": "What Are Economies of Scale?\nImagine your business is a ship. At first, sailing a small boat, every wave feels like a mountain. But as your ship grows, those waves become less daunting. This is what happens with your costs when your business scales up. Economies of scale occur when increasing the volume of production leads to a lower cost per unit. This is a sweet spot for entrepreneurs, where growing bigger means becoming more cost-efficient.\n\n\nWhy Does ATC Fall with Q?\n\nSpreading of Fixed Costs: Like a jar of peanut butter, the more bread you have to spread it on, the thinner you can spread it. The fixed costs (rent, machinery) get spread over more units, reducing the cost for each one. This effect is visible in the basic equation in the term \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{f}{Q}}\\) which is always decreasing as quantity increases. Economies of scale are primarily generated by the spreading of fixed costs and secondarily by increased productivity.\n\nFor example, larger manufacturing plants may see benefits like less energy use per unit or shared costs over multiple products. Similarly, big firms can often secure capital cheaper or spread R&D costs across the entire company.\nIncreased Productivity: As you produce more, your team learns and improves. Processes become more efficient, reducing the time (and hence cost) needed for each unit. This effect is less visible in the basic equation. If the process becomes more efficient, we should be able to make the same output with fewer resources and lower cost. That means that we would expect the unit cost \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) to be a function of quantity \\(\\mathsf{c(Q)}\\) that decreases as quantity increases.\n\nFor example, investments in specialized machinery or staff training to increase proficiency and reduce errors lowers costs as production scales.\n\n\n\nThe Basic Equation\nIn simple terms, the average total cost (ATC) decreases as the quantity of output (Q) increases. Remember that the basic equation for cost is\n\\[ \\mathsf{C = f + cQ}\\] where\n\n\\(\\mathsf{C}\\) is total cost;\n\\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is fixed cost and doesn’t change with quantity;\n\\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is unit cost; and\n\\(\\mathsf{cQ}\\) is variable cost and changes directly with quantity.\n\nThe equation for average total cost (ATC) is\n\\[ \\mathsf{ATC = \\frac{C}{Q} = \\frac{f}{Q} + c. } \\]\n\n\nEstimating the Scale Curve: The Power of the Power Function\nWe can see that economies of scale have a compound effect of spreading fixed cost \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{f}{Q}}\\) and increased efficiency reducing unit cost \\(\\mathsf{c(Q)}\\). We tend to estimate how \\(\\mathsf{ATC}\\) changes with \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) using a power function:\n\\[ \\mathsf{ATC = a Q^b}\\] where:\n\n\\(\\mathsf{a}\\) is a constant showing initial cost levels.\n\\(\\mathsf{b}\\) is the parameter, usually a negative number, indicating how quickly costs fall as Q rises. If you’re not math-inclined, think of it as a way to gauge how steeply your costs will decrease as you ramp up production. The steeper the curve, the greater the potential savings.\n\nWe will explore how to estimate the effects of economies of scale in the case of the Liberty Ship in ?sec-liberty.\n\n\nThe Flip Side: Diseconomies of Scale\nBut beware, like a too-big ship that’s hard to steer, growing your business too much, too fast, can lead to higher costs per unit—this is called diseconomies of scale. It could be due to over-complicated management, increased transportation costs, or simply because workers feel lost in a company that’s become too large.\n\n\nThe Sweet Spot: Minimum Efficient Scale (MES)\nMES is where your business operates in the most cost-effective manner. It’s not just about being big; it’s about being the right size in your market. If you’re smaller than MES, you’re not spreading costs effectively. Bigger than MES? You might be facing diseconomies.",

    "section": "8.2 The Learning Curve",
    "text": "8.2 The Learning Curve\nGaining experience in your business operations can lead to a decrease in variable costs, allowing you to get to break-even faster. This experience manifests through the learning curve, which captures how businesses typically get better—and thus, more cost-efficient—at what they do over time.\n\nWhat is the learning curve?\nThe concept of a learning curve is straightforward: the more you produce, the better you get at it, and the less it costs to make each additional item. Specifically, costs tend to drop by a consistent percentage each time your total production doubles.\n\n\nWhy does cost per unit fall with cumulative experience?\nLearning curves stem from numerous improvements as your business matures, such as increased labor productivity, better process control, product enhancements, and increased efficiency across operations. While learning curves are especially relevant in manufacturing and labor-intensive settings, they’re also applicable to startups that are outsourcing in the beginning. As you gain experience and shift towards more in-house production, these benefits become more pronounced.\n\n\nThe Basic Equation(s)\nUsually, the learning curve is characterized by a constant percentage reduction in cost associated with a doubling of production. This is best expressed by the traditional learning curve formula as a power function:\n\\[ \\mathsf{c_{N} = c_{1} \\  N^{b}} \\] where\n\n\\(\\mathsf{c_{N}}\\) is the unit cost to produce the N-th unit – it is a dynamic form of the unit cost \\(\\mathsf{c}\\).\n\\(\\mathsf{c_{1}}\\) is the unit cost to produce the first unit.\n\\(\\mathsf{N}\\) is the total (cumulative) number of units produced so far.\n\\(\\mathsf{b}\\) is the learning parameter, a negative number telling us how quickly costs fall.\n\nLearning curves of this form have the feature that they decrease by a fixed percent every time cumulative experience \\(\\mathsf{N}\\) doubles. For example, if we have an “80 percent learning curve,” it means that with every doubling of total output, the cost per unit drops to 80 percent of what it was prior to the doubling—a 20 percent reduction.\nThe relationship between the learning rate (the percentage of cost that remains after each doubling of experience) and the learning parameter \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) can be calculated with these formulas:\n\\[\n\\mathsf{b = \\frac{log(r)}{log(2)}}\n\\] where \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) is the learning parameter and \\(\\mathsf{r}\\) is the learning rate meaning the percentage of the previous level of cost the learning curve will bring the cost down to. For example, for an 80 percent learning curve, \\(\\mathsf{r = 0.80}\\) so\n\\[\n\\mathsf{b = \\frac{log(0.80)}{log(2)} = -0.3219}\n\\]\nIf we know the learning parameter \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) but not the learning rate \\(\\mathsf{r}\\), we calculate \\(\\mathsf{r}\\) with \\[\n\\mathsf{r = 2^{-b}}\n\\] For an 80 percent learning curve, we know that the learning parameter \\(\\mathsf{b = -0.3219}\\) so\n\\[\n\\mathsf{r = 2^{-0.3219281} = 0.8.}\n\\]\n\n\nLearning Curve in Action\nThe impact of the learning curve is illustrated by how variable costs decrease over time. For a starting variable cost of $100, an 80 percent learning curve shows a drop to $22.71 after 100 units. Figure 8.1 displays these cost paths for 90 percent, 80 percent, and 70 percent learning curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: 90 percent, 80 percent, and 70 percent learning curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing Strategy and the Learning Curve\nSometimes, setting a price below your current unit cost can be strategic if it helps accumulate experience faster, thus reducing costs more quickly. But it’s crucial to accurately understand your learning curve because an overestimate can lead to delayed profitability.",

It is made of slash resistant fabric in nondescript colors to avoid the attention that more popular colorful brands draw. Let’s look at the cost of having the Dorsal pack manufactured by a contract manufacturer. The manufacturer charges $40 per backpack to be manufactured, packaged, and delivered to the start-up’s offices. The start up is also spending $200 per month for web hosting and $5500 per month for contracted web development.

    "text": "9.1 Why Profitability Matters\nEntrepreneurship is, at its essence, an economic activity and profitability is the cornerstone of entrepreneurial success. Profitability is not just a financial metric, but a comprehensive indicator of your startup’s health, sustainability, and potential for growth.\nProfitability represents the ability of a business to generate more revenue than it spends in costs. It’s the lifeblood of any venture, determining its viability and long-term success. For entrepreneurs, profitability is not merely a goal; it’s a vital sign of their startup’s effectiveness in creating value and its efficiency in managing resources.\nFor startups, the path to profitability is often challenging yet imperative. It’s a clear indicator to investors and stakeholders of your business’s potential. Profitability demonstrates that your startup is not just an idea but a functional entity capable of sustaining itself and scaling. It reassures that the business model is sound, the market demand is adequately met, and the operational efficiencies are in place.\nThis chapter stands at the confluence of the preceding discussions on demand, revenue, and cost. Here, we weave these elements together to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to calculate and evaluate your startup’s profitability. We will delve into the analytics of profitability, using data-driven insights to make informed decisions.\nYou’ve learned about demand curves, understood revenue streams, and dissected cost structures. Now, it’s time to integrate these concepts. We’ll start with the maximization of profit - identifying the optimal balance between revenue generation and cost management. This section will not only discuss the theoretical aspects but also demonstrate practical analytical methods to derive these insights.\nFollowing this, we will explore how to utilize the optimal pricing strategy, gleaned from profit maximization, to conduct a thorough break-even analysis. This analysis is crucial in understanding at what point your startup stops operating at a loss and starts generating profits.\nRemember, profitability is more than a number; it’s a testament to your startup’s ability to thrive in a competitive landscape. Through this chapter, you will gain the analytical acumen to not just dream of profitability but to strategically plan for it, measure it, and achieve it.",

Price is something you set in your optimization. Quantity is determined by customers’ demand given the choice of price. Variable unit cost \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) and fixed cost \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) are determined by the cost structure chosen to produce the product or service you offer for sale. In short, the earlier chapters in demand, revenue and cost formed the building blocks we need to calculate profit.\nBut there’s a catch: revenue (driven by demand) and cost data often don’t align. Typically, demand data comes from a small sample of customers, while cost data reflects the entire market. Imagine trying to cover the costs of a nationwide campaign with just a local fundraiser’s revenue - it doesn’t add up.\n\nThe Solution: Rescaling\nTo resolve this, we either scale up demand to match market size or scale down fixed costs to the sample size.\n\nScaling up demand: Multiply your sample-based demand by a factor that represents the market size.\nScaling down fixed cost: Adjust the market-level fixed costs to reflect the proportion attributed to your sample size.\n\n\n\nScaling Up Demand\nLet’s say our sample demand curve from 100 respondents is:\n\\[ \\mathsf{Q_{sample} = 327 - 2.19 \\ P.} \\] With a market of 1,000,000,000 potential customers, our sample is just a tiny fraction. To scale up, multiply by the scaling factor \\(\\mathsf{m = \\frac{Population}{Sample} = 10000}\\).\nHere’s the math magic:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{m \\cdot Q_{sample}} &= \\mathsf{m \\cdot (327 - 2.19 \\ P)}  \\\\\n        \\mathsf{Q_{market}} &= \\mathsf{327,\\!000 - 21,\\!900 \\ P}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSuddenly, the prospect of covering market-level costs seems realistic!\nThe market-level profit equation then becomes:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{\\pi_{market}} =& \\mathsf{\\  P\\ Q_{market} - f_{market} - c\\ Q_{market}} \\\\\n                      =& \\mathsf{\\ P \\ (3\\,270\\,000 - 21\\,900 \\ P)} - \\\\\n                      & \\qquad \\mathsf{ 1\\,000\\,000 - 1.5 \\ (3\\,270\\,000 - 21\\,900 \\ P) }\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nScaling Down Fixed Cost\nImagine the fixed cost to serve the market is $1,000,000. To scale this to our sample size:\nDivide the fixed cost by the scaling factor \\(m\\). Now, your sample’s share of the fixed cost is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{C_{sample}} &= \\mathsf{ \\frac{f_{market} }{m} + c\\ Q} \\\\[8pt]\n                    &= \\mathsf{ \\frac{1\\ 000\\ 000}{100} + 1.5 \\ Q} \\\\[8pt]\n                    &= \\mathsf{ 10\\ 000 + 1.5 \\ Q}\n\\end{align}\\]\nYour sample-level profit equation is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{\\pi_{sample}} =& \\mathsf{\\  P\\ Q_{sample} - f_{sample} - c\\ Q_{sample}} \\\\\n                      =& \\mathsf{\\  P \\ (327 - 2.19 \\ P) - 100 - 1.5 \\ (327 - 2.19 \\ P) }\n\\end{align}\\]\nThrough rescaling, we align our demand data with our cost data, enabling an accurate and realistic profitability analysis. It’s a crucial step in ensuring your entrepreneurial decisions are data-driven and grounded in financial reality.",

    "text": "9.3 Maximize Profit\nIn the journey toward understanding profitability, we’ve navigated through the intricacies of demand curves, revenue models, and cost structures. Now, we arrive at the pivotal concept of maximizing profit, a critical goal for any entrepreneur. The essence of profitability lies not just in generating revenue but in outpacing costs, a balance heavily influenced by market competition.\n\nMonopoly Profits and Market Choice\nAs an entrepreneur, the choice of market and problem-solving approach significantly impacts your profitability potential. Ideally, operating as a monopolist, where you’re the sole provider of a unique solution, offers the highest profit margin. However, true monopolies are rare. They represent the upper bound of profitability you can expect to earn, serving as a benchmark for assessing performance in more competitive contexts.\nMonopoly Characteristics:\n\nSingle Firm Dominance: A market with one powerful firm.\nComplete Product Differentiation: No rival products, ensuring complete market control.\nStrong Entry Barriers: Prevent potential competitors from entering the market.\nPowerless Customers: Large customer base with limited individual influence on price.\nPerfect Information: Complete awareness of prices and availability among buyers and sellers.\n\nIn monopoly settings, profit (denoted \\(\\mathsf{\\pi}\\)) is the difference between revenue (\\(\\mathsf{R}\\)) and cost (\\(\\mathsf{C}\\)) with the profit equation \\(\\mathsf{ \\pi = R - C}\\). To illustrate, consider the demand, revenue, and cost functions from earlier chapters:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\mathsf{Q} &= \\mathsf{2000 - 2P} \\\\\n\n\\mathsf{R} &= \\mathsf{2000P - 2P^2} \\\\\n\n\\mathsf{C} &= \\mathsf{50,\\!000 + 200 Q} \\\\\n           &= \\mathsf{450,\\!000 - 400P}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nThese core elements of the profit function yield a final profit function of \\[ \\mathsf{\\pi = 1600 P - 2P^2 - 450,\\!000.} \\] as depicted in Figure 9.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Profit as the difference between revenue and cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing Profit through Optimal Pricing\nThe crux of profit maximization lies in setting the right price. The optimal price is the one that marks the greatest distance between revenue and cost. This is illustrated in Figure 9.2.\n\nRevenue Maximizing Price: At first glance, it might seem logical to aim for the price that maximizes revenue. For example, our analysis shows that at a price of $500, the revenue hits its peak. However, this doesn’t translate to maximum profit. Despite generating a profit of $250,000 at this price, a closer look at Figure 9.2 reveals that we’re not optimizing our profit potential here.\nProfit Maximizing Price: Diving deeper, we discover that the key to maximizing profit lies not in the revenue peak but at a different price point. By adjusting the price to $600, we find the sweet spot where profit is maximized at $270,000. This is a crucial insight for entrepreneurs: the price that maximizes revenue is not the one that maximizes profit.\n\nIn short, the goal is always to find the profit maximizing price. While it might be tempting to chase the highest revenue, it’s the profit that ultimately sustains and grows your business.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Profit earned at the revenue maximizing price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Monopoly: Preparing for Competitive Markets\nWhile our analysis so far assumes a monopolistic setting, most startups eventually face competition. The upcoming chapters delve into oligopoly and game theory, crucial for understanding competitive dynamics. This understanding will further refine our analysis of profitability, accounting for competitor interactions and market responses.",

    "section": "9.4 Break-even Analysis",
    "text": "9.4 Break-even Analysis\nA critical task for you as an entrepreneur is to ensure your selling price per unit surpasses your cost per unit. This sounds simple, but it’s nuanced. If your venture has no fixed costs, just ensure your price is above your average variable cost. However, most businesses do face fixed costs, meaning your total revenue over a period must exceed all your costs, including these fixed expenses. Remember, covering fixed costs can take time, and your venture needs sufficient revenue growth to meet these expenses.\nBreak-even analysis helps you determine the break-even quantity - the volume of sales needed to cover all costs without making a profit. Before you reach break-even, you are operating at a loss that you must cover with debt or investor money. After you reach break-even, you can begin paying back the losses you incurred before reaching break-even. Without large amounts of outside funding, it may be necessary to invest in a different cost structure that is more favorable in the short-run even if it leads to higher costs in the long run. If this condition seems unreachable, it’s a red flag for your business model.\n\nCalculating Break-Even Quantity\nThe key to break-even analysis is to determine how many units you must sell to cover your fixed costs in additions to your variable costs. To find this quantity, set your profit function (revenue minus costs) to zero, assuming you know your profit-maximizing price \\(\\mathsf{P^*}\\) . The break-even quantity, denoted as \\(\\mathsf{\\underline{Q}}\\), is then calculated by dividing your fixed costs by the margin (price minus variable cost). The equation is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n          \\mathsf{\\pi} &= \\mathsf{P\\ Q - f - cQ} = 0 \\notag \\\\[8pt]\n\\mathsf{\\underline{Q}} &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{f}{P^*-c}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhich is, in words, the fixed cost divided by the margin.\n\n\nApplying Break-Even Analysis: A Practical Example\nImagine you estimated a demand curve from a sample of potential customers:\n\\[ \\mathsf{q = 12 - 0.02 \\ p.} \\]\nScaling this demand curve up to your target market size is essential. Let’s say your potential market is 250,000 customers, scaled up from the 50 in your sample. Your adjusted demand curve becomes:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathsf{Q} &= \\mathsf{\\frac{250,\\!000}{50} \\ q} \\\\[8pt]\n           &= \\mathsf{60,\\!000 - 100 P}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nNow, using a specific cost structure:\n\\[ \\mathsf{C = 50,\\!000 - 200Q} \\]\nThis combination of demand and cost curves leads to a profit-maximizing price of \\(\\mathsf{P^* = \\$400}\\) and maximized profit at that price is \\(\\mathsf{\\pi = \\$3,\\!950,\\!000}\\). With the demand curve, cost curve, and profit maximizing price, break-even quantity is a simple calculation.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{\\underline{Q}} &= \\mathsf{\\frac{f}{P^*\\! - c} = \\frac{50,\\!000}{400 - 200} } \\\\[8pt]\n                       &= \\mathsf{\\frac{50,\\!000}{200} }\\\\[8pt]\n                       &= \\mathsf{250}.\n\\end{align}\\]\nBefore this startup is able to reliably sell 250 units, it is operating at a loss. Every unit of quantity above 250 generates positive profit.\nThe relationship between revenue, cost, and break-even quantity is illustrated in Figure 9.3.\n\n###  Break even quantity\nf &lt;- 50000\nc &lt;- 200\n\nfTC &lt;- function(Q) f + c*Q\nfF &lt;- function(Q) f \n\nPstar &lt;- 400\nfR &lt;- function(Q) Pstar * Q \n\nrev_bounds &lt;- tibble(x = c(0, 500))    # Create tibble containing plot range for x-axis (P)\neqn1 &lt;- \" R = P Q = 400 Q\"\neqn2 &lt;- \" C = 50,000 + 200 Q \"\neqn3 &lt;- \" underline(Q) == 250 \"\neqn4 &lt;- \" f = 50,000 \"\nggplot(rev_bounds, aes(x)) +                     # Draw ggplot2 plot\n  #\n  \n  #\n  geom_function(fun = fF, color = \"#FA7240\", linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_function(fun = fTC, color = \"#DA0406\", linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_function(fun = fR, color = \"RoyalBlue\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(#title = \"Revenue for a ticket to a dollar theater\",\n    x = \"Quantity\",\n    y = \"Revenue and Cost\") +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=360, y=170000, label=\"Revenue\", hjust = 1, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=360, y=158000, label=eqn1, hjust = 1, size = 3, parse=F) +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=450, y=120000, label=\"Total Cost\", hjust = 0.5, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=450, y=108000, label=eqn2, hjust = 0.5, size = 3, parse=F) +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=260, y=18000, label=\"Break-even Quantity\", hjust = 0, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=260, y=6000, label=eqn3, hjust = 0, size = 3, parse=TRUE) +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=400, y=68000, label=\"Fixed Cost\", hjust = 0.5, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=400, y=56000, label=eqn4, hjust = 0.5, size = 3, parse=F) +\n  #\n  #scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  scale_y_continuous(lim = c(-0,200000), labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  theme_hc() + # base size = 12, font family = sans, ... \n  #  scale_color_brewer(palette=\"GnBu\", direction=-1) +\n  theme(legend.justification=c(0, 1), legend.position=c(1.8, 1)) # hides legend outside the frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Break-even quantity where revenue equals cost and positive profits begin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak-even Quantity and Time Determine Your Funding Needs\nThe relationship between revenue, cost, and break-even quantity, illustrated in Figure 9.3 tells you the scale needed for profitability. However, it doesn’t indicate the time required to reach this scale, which depends on sales growth. Depending on demand, you may expect to sell 250 units every hour or it may take more than a year to sell that many units.\nYou should estimate how long you think it will take for your sales to reach the break-even quantity based on your demand curve and your early growth rate. That estimate will guide you in how much money you will need from outside sources for your venture to reach profitability. Estimate how much time it’ll take for your sales to reach the break-even quantity. This will guide your funding needs to sustain the venture until it becomes profitable.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of Cost Structure\nBreak-even analysis isn’t just a mathematical exercise; it’s a strategic tool. It guides your decisions on cost structures and underscores the importance of understanding your market and sales potential. Different cost structures lead to different break-even points and, by extension, different funding requirements. This is detailed in Table 9.1.

Imagine the latest models with their array of features: airbags, anti-lock brakes, anti-theft systems, and a suite of automated systems like GPS, on-board WIFI, and self-driving capabilities. Initially, these features are exclusive to luxury cars due to their high development costs. But as technology evolves, even entry-level cars start boasting these sophisticated systems. By 2016, electronics constitute a third of a car’s cost, a significant price bump passed on to consumers. For tech enthusiasts, this is a bargain; for those seeking basic transportation, it’s a steep price to pay.\nThe Market Gap: Simplicity in Complexity\nAmidst this tech escalation, there’s a gap: what about consumers who want simple, affordable cars? This overlooked segment could represent a unique entrepreneurial opportunity. What if you could start a company focused on building basic, low-tech cars? Let’s dive into the financial feasibility of this idea.\nThe Cost of Car-Making\nDeveloping a new car platform is a costly affair, typically ranging from $700 million to $2 billion. Our approach, eschewing expensive tech, might reduce these costs. Let’s estimate a development cost of $500 million, allocated to design, engineering, and factory retooling. The big automakers average a $2500 profit per car, but for smaller, simpler cars, this margin might shrink to $2000. To break even, you’d need to sell a quarter of a million cars - a daunting target.\nReality Check: The Sales Challenge\nIn 2015, the U.S. car market saw record-breaking sales of 1.7 million cars. But how realistic is our target of 250,000 cars? Comparing with smaller, established brands like Buick, Acura, or Land Rover offers perspective. These brands sold hundreds of thousands of cars annually, but a new brand like ours would likely start much smaller. Tesla, a relatively new entrant, sold only 22,800 cars in 2015. At that rate, it would take over a decade to recover the development costs.\nThe High Stakes of High Fixed Costs\nThe auto industry’s high fixed-cost structure presents a formidable barrier to new entrants, especially at the low-end market. Tesla’s success comes from catering to an affluent customer base, offering high-tech cars at premium prices. Our proposed venture sits at the opposite end: targeting cost-conscious consumers with simpler, cheaper vehicles. The challenge is immense: attract enough buyers willing to trade tech for savings and achieve the massive sales volume needed to cover the fixed costs.\nThe Verdict: A Tough Road Ahead\nIn conclusion, breaking into the auto industry at the low end poses significant risks. The sheer volume of sales needed to cover fixed costs is daunting, and the competitive landscape is unforgiving. Any entrepreneur eyeing this opportunity must carefully weigh these factors against the potential of tapping into an underserved market.",

    "text": "9.5 Workout Problems\n\nDorsal Packs\nA group of entrepreneurs, concerned about pick-pocketing in tourist destinations, created the Dorsal travel pack. This stylish, modern backpack has zippers facing inward, toward the back of the wearer, for security. For added security, it is made of slash-resistant fabric in nondescript colors to avoid the attention that more colorful, fashion-oriented brands draw.\nThe team validated the problem and solution, refined the concept, and confirmed direct sales through their website. They conducted a profitability analysis with 107 potential customers, who rated the innovation, suggested improvements, stated their maximum willingness to pay, and provided travel and demographic information.\n\n\nDorsal Pack data\nInitially, the team reached out to members of their social networks and invited those who had recently traveled or were planning to travel in the near future to help. They were able to get 112 responses from potential customers who had traveled or were about to travel.\n\nDemand and Revenue\nThe respondents were shown the backpack and its features. They were asked to rate the innovation and offer suggestions to improve it. They were also asked “What is the most you would be willing to pay for the Dorsal travel pack?” Finally, they provided information about their travel patterns as well as demographics. Because the travel pack is a durable good for most travelers, they focused on the of willingness to pay from respondents who had traveled or were planning to travel soon. We see the following responses:\n\ndp &lt;- tibble(wtp = c(64, 18, 46, 92, 110, 138, 113, 89, 0, 258, 205, 0, 18, 202, 46, 258, 0, 141, 0, 46, 61, 101, 64, 215, 95, 43, 46, 46, 132, 21, 18, 113, 9, 18, 21, 18, 104, 6, 0, 101, 6, 224, 322, 18, 316, 156, 104, 322, 285, 208, 316, 0, 288, 95, 6, 52, 46, 0, 18, 64, 98, 248, 18, 110, 0, 67, 0, 18, 0, 89, 132, 101, 18, 215, 18, 0, 0, 104, 285, 3, 46, 141, 322, 291, 89, 0, 101, 113, 67, 58, 132, 215, 224, 291, 9, 291, 267, 6, 6, 61, 178, 285, 64, 126, 0, 101, 15))\n\n# inspect the data\nglimpse(dp)\n\nRows: 107\nColumns: 1\n$ wtp &lt;dbl&gt; 64, 18, 46, 92, 110, 138, 113, 89, 0, 258, 205, 0, 18, 202, 46, 25…\n\n\n\n\nCost Structure\nDorsal plans to have the pack manufactured by a contract manufacturer who charges $40 per backpack to be manufactured, packaged, and delivered to the startup’s offices. The startup is also spending $200 per month for web hosting and $5500 per month for contracted web development. Their total cost curve is linear: \\(\\mathsf{C = cQ + f}\\) where \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is the variable cost per unit and \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is fixed cost per month.\n\n\nRescaling\nTo conduct profitability analytics, it’s crucial to align the scale of sample demand with the fixed costs required to serve the market. For this analysis, we will rescale the demand up to the market level. Concerning market size:\n\nInternational Travelers from the U.S.: According to the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office, approximately 93 million international trips were made by U.S. citizens in 2019. We focus on 2019 data because international travel dynamics significantly changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent recovery data is not yet fully available.\n\nWe estimate that the average international traveler makes about 1.5 trips per year, accounting for both frequent travelers and those who rarely travel abroad.\nIt is generally estimated that 70 to 80 percent of these trips are for leisure purposes.\nCombining these factors, we assume there were approximately 43.4 million unique international travelers in 2019.\n\nPercentage of Young Travelers Likely to Use a Backpack: While detailed data is unavailable, a conservative estimate suggests that 25% of these travelers are in the 20-39 age group, a demographic typically more active in international travel. This estimation brings our target population down to 10.85 million.\nInterest in Security: Estimating the proportion interested in security-enhanced travel gear is challenging. However, considering increased travel safety awareness, we assume that around 20% of the travelers in this age group might be interested in a more secure backpack. This further narrows our target population to approximately 2.17 million.\nMarket share in a crowded backpack market: Recognizing the diverse needs and preferences of travelers, as well as the crowded nature of the backpack market, achieving a 1-5% market share would be substantial. Opting for a midpoint estimate of 3%, we approximate the target market to be around 65,100 potential customers.\n\nIn summary, our assumption for the target market is about 65,100 potential travelers, and the Dorsal team has sampled data from 112 individuals within this segment for their analysis.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat is the rescaling factor \\(\\mathsf{m}\\) based on the calculation of the target population?\nHow many backpacks would you expect to sell to the sample of 107 respondents at a price of $110?\nHow many backpacks would you expect to sell to the complete market at a price of $110?\nWhat is the fixed cost?\nWhat is the unit variable cost?\nWhat is the profit maximizing price for a Dorsal pack? Use the rescaled market demand curve for your calculation and continue to use the market demand for the rest of the questions.\nWhat is the quantity of travel packs sold at the profit maximizing price?\nWhat is the revenue earned by selling Dorsal packs at the profit maximizing price?\nWhat is the profit earned by selling Dorsal packs at the profit maximizing price?\nWhat is the difference between the profit maximizing price and the revenue maximizing price for Dorsal packs? Specifically calculate this as \\(\\mathsf{P^*_{\\pi_{max}} - P^*_{R_{max}}}\\).\nWhat is the difference between the revenue when charging the profit maximizing price and the revenue when charging the revenue maximizing price for Dorsal packs? Specifically, calculate this as \\(\\mathsf{R^*_{\\pi_{max}} - R^*_{R_{max}}}\\).\nWhat is the difference between the profit when charging the profit maximizing price and the profit when charging the revenue maximizing price for Dorsal packs. Specifically, calculate this as \\(\\mathsf{\\pi^*_{\\pi_{max}} - \\pi^*_{R_{max}}}\\).\nShould the Dorsal pack team charge the profit maximizing price or the revenue maximizing price? Choose the best price and un-comment it.\n\nbest_price &lt;- “They should charge the profit maximizing price.”\nbest_price &lt;- “They should charge the revenue maximizing price.”\n\nThe Dorsal pack team is seeking funding from investors and wants to be able to communicate how long it will need investor funding to reach profitability. What is the breakeven quantity for the Dorsal pack?\n  Hint: You can calculate this two different ways:\n\nThe simple formula in the reading;\nCreate a profit function as a function of quantity and find its root.",

    "text": "10.1 Competition in Oligopoly\nCompetition is fundamentally about contending with competitors to capture and retain customers. This contest is not merely a battle for market share, but a critical determinant of a company’s overall performance and viability. The demand a business creates with its product or service defines its ability to attract customers.\nAt its core, competition in business is a zero-sum game in the quest for customers. Every customer won is a gain for one company and a loss for another. This dynamic shapes the demand landscape, where the success of a product or service hinges on its ability to attract and retain customers. As one company’s offering gains favor, its competitors inevitably feel the pinch, leading to shifts in market demand.\nThe real battleground in business competition, however, lies in profitability. Various strategies, from innovative pricing to creative marketing and beyond, are deployed to capture customer interest. The goal is not just to increase sales but to do so in a way that amplifies profits. For instance, a company that manages to distinguish its product, appealing more to customer preferences than its competitors, can boost demand. If the cost of this differentiation is outweighed by the increase in revenue, the result is a net gain in profitability.\nTraditional economic models paint a picture of competition as either a monopoly, where one company reigns supreme, or a perfectly competitive arena with many players and no clear leaders. For startups, however, reality is typically found somewhere in between.",

    "text": "Competitive Extremes\n\nEntrepreneurs dream of monopoly but it is a pipe dream\nThe idea of a monopoly, where a single firm controls the market, is often touted as the holy grail for startups. Peter Thiel (2014), for instance, champions the pursuit of monopolistic status as the path to significant profitability and market and pricing control. However, true monopolies are exceedingly rare and often not a practical goal for most entrepreneurs.\n\n\nEntrepreneurs in perfect competition are living a nightmare\nOn the other end of the spectrum, perfect competition, characterized by numerous players and uniform products, presents a challenging environment with limited rewards. In such markets, companies have little control over pricing and face intense competition, leading to razor-thin profit margins. While it’s crucial to understand the dynamics of perfect competition, as an entrepreneur, steering clear of such markets is advisable.1\n\n\nAwake entrepreneurs compete in the reality of oligopoly\nMost startups find themselves in oligopolies - markets dominated by a few firms engaged in a sophisticated dance of action and reaction. This market structure demands a keen understanding of strategic interplay among competitors, be it in pricing, product innovation, or marketing.\n\n\n\nCompetition in Bertrand Oligopolies\nFor entrepreneurs, the most relevant form of oligopoly is often Bertrand competition, which encompasses both highly differentiated markets and those with minimal differentiation. This chapter delves into Bertrand competition, offering insights and strategies for startups to navigate and thrive in these competitive waters.2",

    "text": "10.2 The Realities of Competing on Price\n\nAvoid the Quicksand of Price Competition\nSuccessful companies continuously strategize to captivate their target customers. One common approach is enhancing product value through innovation and effective branding. However, a more direct and often perilous route is through price competition—lowering prices to divert customers from competitors. This method, while immediately impactful, can trigger a chain reaction of price matching or undercutting by competitors, culminating in a harmful price war. The more they compete, the further they sink into price wars. Such wars often result in selling similar quantities but at continually decreasing prices, eroding profits for all involved.\n\n\nThe Inevitability of Competing on Price\nDespite the evident risks of price competition, it’s crucial to acknowledge a fundamental truth: all firms, in one way or another, compete on price. The pricing decisions made by businesses significantly influence customer purchasing choices, thus determining the demand for their products. Price considerations remain paramount even when a company’s focus is on non-price factors like product features or brand allure. The challenge lies in strategically setting prices that optimize profit without igniting a price war.\n\n\nExtend Strategic Focus to Pricing and Beyond\nOur goal is to master the art of competing effectively while not solely relying on price. This requires a keen understanding of oligopoly markets, particularly in contexts where the temptation to engage in price battles is strongest. We delve into the concept of undifferentiated Bertrand oligopoly, where the allure and risks of pure price competition loom large, and contrast it with differentiated Bertrand oligopoly. In the latter, product differentiation plays a pivotal role, offering avenues to sidestep a battle centered only on price.\n\n\nDiverse Customers Prefer Diverse Products over Lower Prices\nThe idea that a race to the lowest price benefits customers seems appealing, especially in markets with undifferentiated products. It suggests a scenario where everyone gets exactly what they want at the lowest possible price. However, this notion overlooks a critical aspect of consumer behavior: heterogeneity in customer preferences. Customers often seek varied products that cater specifically to their unique needs. In such a diverse marketplace, the lowest price for a one-size-fits-all product is rarely the most attractive option. This is true even in segments with limited incomes, where the demand for variety and specificity remains robust. Therefore, a market thriving on serving customer diversity often trumps one racing to the bottom in pricing, especially in meeting the nuanced needs of a varied customer base.",

    "section": "10.3 Undifferentiated Bertrand Oligopoly",
    "text": "10.3 Undifferentiated Bertrand Oligopoly\nOligopolies, which lie between perfect competition and monopoly, present unique competitive dynamics. In undifferentiated Bertrand competition, a few key conditions prevail:\n\nA Few, Powerful Firms: These firms can influence market equilibrium and each other’s behaviors.\nUndifferentiated Products: Customers see no difference between products from different firms.\nEntry Barriers: These maintain industry concentration.\nMany Powerless Customers: Customers lack influence over market dynamics.\nPerfect Information: Everyone knows all prices and product availabilities.\nPrice-Based Competition: Firms compete primarily through pricing strategies.\nUnlimited Capacity: Firms can meet any market demand.\n\n\nPrice Wars Are Rational but Mutually Destructive\nImagine a market with just two firms (a duopoly) where products and costs are identical. When one firm sets a price, the other has three options: match it, price higher, or undercut it. The logical move is to undercut, capturing the entire market at a slightly reduced price. This, however, prompts the first firm to respond with its own price cut to regain the market, leading to a continuous undercutting cycle.\nThis strategic price reduction leads to a price war, with both firms lowering their prices in tandem. Equilibrium is eventually reached when prices fall to the leveo of costs. At this point, lowering prices further would mean operating at a loss, so no incentive remains for either firm to change their pricing strategy. This situation, where firms end up earning zero economic profit, represents the epitome of fierce price competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Profit vs. Accounting Profit\n\n\n\nZero economic profit doesn’t imply the absence of accounting profit. It means the business is viable—it covers all expenses and compensates for the entrepreneur’s time and capital—but doesn’t generate surplus profits beyond what could be earned elsewhere with the same investment of time and resources.\n\n\nThe equilibrium where a firm’s best response is to set price equal to cost is competition at its worst.3 It highlights the need to avoid competing solely on prices. What can a company do in this situation to avoid price wars and zero profit?\n\n\nStrategies to Avoid the Price War Trap\n\nGaining a Cost Advantage\nOne effective strategy to steer clear of price wars in undifferentiated Bertrand competition is to establish a cost advantage. Consider firms with varying costs due to different technologies. The firm with the lowest marginal cost (Firm 1) and the next lowest (Firm 2) set the stage for market dynamics.\n\nMarket Dynamics with Varied Costs: When the market price equates to the cost of the higher-cost firm, that firm can’t gain by reducing its price. However, the lower-cost firm (Firm 1) continues to have the incentive to undercut. This process drives the higher-cost firm out of the market, with the price cutting halting at the cost level of Firm 2.\nPosition of the Lowest-Cost Firm: Firm 1, with the lowest cost, doesn’t become a monopolist but instead dominates the market share, constrained by the cost structure of its closest competitor (Firm 2). Its pricing power is limited, capping just below the cost of Firm 2.\n\n\n\nExploiting Capacity Constraints\nTypically, in undifferentiated Bertrand oligopolies, it’s assumed that firms can satisfy total market demand at the lowest price. However, adding capacity constraints changes this assumption and the resultant market behavior. Firms can only sell as much as they can produce, even if they offer the lowest price, altering the usual trajectory of a price war and offering some protection against it.\n\n\nDemonstrative Example: Capacity Constraints in Action\n\nSetting the Market Scene\nImagine a scenario in a market where no single firm can satisfy more than 40% of the total demand at the equilibrium price. In such a setup, a minimum of three firms is necessary to fully meet market demand. Let’s consider three firms with the following variable costs:\n\nFirm 1’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_1 = \\$10}\\)\nFirm 2’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_2 = \\$20}\\)\nFirm 3’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_3 = \\$30}\\)\n\n\n\nMarket Dynamics and Pricing\nIn this market structure, the pricing will stabilize at \\(\\mathsf{\\$30}\\), aligning with the highest variable unit cost among the firms. Here’s how the market share gets distributed: Firms 1 and 2, with their cost advantages, capture 40% of the market each and Firm 3, with the highest cost, caters to the remaining 20%.\n\nFirm 1’s market share: 40% of the market\nFirm 2’s market share: 40% of the market\nFirm 3’s market share: 20% of the market\n\nWhen Firm 3 attempts to expand its market share beyond this 20%, Firms 1 and 2 have the leeway to reduce their prices below \\(\\mathsf{\\$30}\\). Their lower costs enable them to do so while maintaining profitability. As a result, Firm 3, operating at the brink of its cost, can only break even and finds itself unable to compete with the lowered prices.\n\n\nImpact of a New Entrant\nNow, introduce a twist in the market with the entry of Firm 4, which has a marginal cost of \\(\\mathsf{\\$25}\\). This new competitive dynamic would push the market price down to \\(\\mathsf{\\$25,}\\) effectively ousting Firm 3 from the market. Firms 1 and 2, despite experiencing a dip in their profits due to the new lower market price, remain profitable. Firm 4, with its cost aligning with the new market price, manages to break even and captures the market share previously held by Firm 3.\n\n\nStrategic Implications\nThis example highlights how capacity constraints and varying cost structures among firms can significantly influence market pricing and distribution of market shares. It illustrates the strategic complexity in an undifferentiated Bertrand oligopoly and underscores the importance of cost management and capacity considerations in competitive positioning.\n\n\n\nMini-mills in the Steel Industry: A Case Study in Undifferentiated Bertrand Competition\nThe emergence of mini-mills in steel production offers a compelling illustration of the dynamics of an undifferentiated Bertrand oligopoly, particularly in the context of heterogeneous variable costs and capacity constraints.\n\nInnovation and Cost Advantage\nMini-mills, an innovative approach to steel production, utilize scrap metal as their primary raw material, contrasting with the traditional integrated steel mills that begin with iron ore. The mini-mills’ process, which starts with already-refined metal, grants them a significant cost advantage over integrated mills. This advantage becomes pronounced in the production of lower-end steel products, such as rebar for construction.\n\n\nMarket Dynamics and Price Impact\nAs mini-mills proliferated, they systematically undercut the integrated mills in the rebar market, leveraging their lower costs. This competitive pressure gradually forced the integrated mills to retreat from this segment. Following their exit, rebar prices experienced a notable 20% decline, equal to the cost advantage of the mini-mills. This pattern—a period of stable prices disrupted by the entry of low-cost innovations and subsequent exit of higher-cost incumbents—consistently resulted in price collapses, aligning with the cost level of the most efficient mini-mills.4\n\n\nThe Commodity Nature of Steel and Market Evolution\nSteel, being a commodity product, exhibits minimal differentiation within each category. Initially, the presence of low-cost mini-mills prompted a shift in market pricing to the level of the highest-cost integrated mills. The mini-mills, with their limited capacity, were able to fill their production to the brim, leaving the remainder of the market demand to the integrated mills.\nHowever, as more mini-mills entered the market, attracted by the potential profits, they brought additional capacity. This increasing capacity from low-cost producers gradually diminished the market share of the higher-cost incumbents. Once the collective capacity of the mini-mills was sufficient to meet market demand, the integrated mills found themselves redundant and exited the market. Subsequently, the price plummeted to the level of the costliest mini-mill.\n\n\nConclusion: The Bertrand Trap for Mini-mills\nThe mini-mills initially enjoyed attractive profits when their capacity was insufficient to meet total market demand. Yet, as their capacity expanded and their costs converged, they found themselves in a classic undifferentiated Bertrand competition scenario. With similar cost structures, the mini-mills faced intense price competition, leading to the inevitable outcome of such markets: prices equalizing to marginal costs and the erosion of extraordinary profits.\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Case: Drop-Shipping\n\nBackground\nIn the dynamic e-commerce landscape, drop-shipping has become a common business model. Companies partner with manufacturers, often in China, to sell products on platforms like Amazon or Shopify. The products are shipped directly from the manufacturer to the customer upon order. This model, while efficient, often leads to intense price competition, especially for undifferentiated products.\n\n\nWith different costs\n\nScenario\nImagine a drop-shipping market with four companies: QuickShip, SpeedyDelivery, FastDrop, and RapidSend. They all sell a similar, popular gadget but have different cost structures due to varying agreements with manufacturers.\n\nMarket Demand: The daily market demand for the gadget is given by \\(\\mathsf{Q=1600−5P}\\), where \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) is the quantity of gadgets and \\(\\mathsf{P}\\) is the selling price.\nCost Structures:\n\n\n\nCompany\nFixed Cost (per day)\nVariable Cost (per unit)\n\n\n\n\nQuickShip\n\\$2000\n\\$60\n\n\nSpeedyDelivery\n\\$2200\n\\$50\n\n\nFastDrop\n\\$2800\n\\$35\n\n\nRapidSend\n\\$3000\n\\$25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive Dynamics\nIn this highly competitive market, companies will undercut each other’s prices. RapidSend, with the lowest variable cost of $25, can profitably offer the gadget at lower prices than competitors. To maximize profits, RapidSend will set a price just low enough to out-compete SpeedyDelivery, the next cheapest competitor.\n\nOptimal Pricing: RapidSend sets the price at $34, undercutting SpeedyDelivery. At this price, RapidSend becomes the sole supplier in the market.\nDemand and Profit Calculation:\n\nAt a price of $34, daily demand is \\(\\mathsf{Q = 1600 − 5 \\cdot 34 = 1430}\\) units.\nRapidSend’s daily profit is \\[\\begin{align}\n\n  \\mathsf{\\pi} &= \\mathsf{(P − c) Q − f} \\\\\n               &= \\mathsf{(34 − 25) \\cdot 1430 − 3000} \\\\\n               &= \\mathsf{\\$9870}.\n  \\end{align}\\]\nQuickShip’s daily profit is $0 if they have not yet entered and can avoid their fixed costs and -$2000 if they have already entered.\nSpeedyDelivery’s daily profit is $0 if they have not yet entered and -$2200 if they have.\nFastDrop’s daily profit is $0 if they have not yet entered and and -$2800 if they have.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith capacity constraints and different costs\n\nScenario\nSuppose each company can only handle a maximum of 390 orders per day. Their cost structures are unchanged from above.\n\n\nCompetitive Dynamics\nWith this capacity constraint, the market dynamics change.\n\nMarket Structure: The market can accommodate up to four firms, with each firm having a maximum capacity of 390 units. Three firms will sell at their capacity of 390 with the fourth selling enough to cover the rest of demand at the equilibrium price.\nEquilibrium Price: The price will adjust to a level where four firms can operate profitably in the market – at the highest-cost firm’s variable unit cost ($60).\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis case demonstrates the competitive nature of drop-shipping in an undifferentiated Bertrand market. The key takeaway is the importance of cost management and capacity constraints in determining market dynamics and profitability. Drop-shipping companies often must navigate intense price competition, where having a cost advantage is crucial for survival and profitability.\n\n\n\nLow Price Guarantees\nSo far, the methods for avoiding price competition have had more to do with variable cost and fixed cost (capacity) than with pricing. Low-price guarantees represent a pricing strategy aimed at avoiding constant price wars.\n\nThe Idea Behind Low-Price Guarantees\nLow-price guarantees are promises made to customers that a firm will match or beat the prices of its competitors. While appearing as a customer-centric approach, these guarantees can actually serve as a strategic tool for the firms themselves.\n\n\nImpact on Price Competition\nIn a typical Bertrand scenario, a small price cut by one firm can lead to it capturing the entire market. This triggers a race to the bottom, with firms continually undercutting each other. However, with a low-price guarantee in place, this dynamic changes:\n\nDeterrent to Undercutting: If a competitor lowers its price, the firm with the guarantee can simply match it, retaining its customers. The competing firm gains no additional market share but suffers a reduction in revenue, removing the incentive to undercut prices.5\nMaintaining Prices Above Cost: These guarantees can help maintain prices at a level above cost, benefiting the firms more than their customers.\n\n\n\nWhy Aren’t Low-Price Guarantees Universal?\nDespite their theoretical effectiveness, low-price guarantees are not universally adopted. The reasons include:\n\nLimited Effectiveness in Differentiated Markets: Firms engaged in differentiated competition find these guarantees less effective and necessary.\nCustomer Hassle Factor: The onus is often on the customer to claim the guarantee, which can be a hassle. Not all customers will go through the process, reducing the effectiveness of the guarantee.\nBranding Over Deterrence: Recent studies suggest that low-price guarantees are often used more for branding and advertising than as a genuine pricing strategy.\n\nWhile low-price guarantees offer some respite from relentless price competition, they are not foolproof. A more sustainable approach for entrepreneurs is to identify a niche market with unmet needs and innovate to provide differentiated solutions. Catering to a heterogeneous group of customers with unique demands can be a more effective path to profitability than relying on pricing strategies alone in an undifferentiated market.",

    "text": "10.4 Differentiated Bertand Oligopoly\nDifferentiated Bertrand competition is arguably the most prevalent form of oligopoly in real-world markets. It’s characterized by product differentiation and strategic pricing—a scenario familiar in industries like cola, desktop computers, automobiles, airlines, and ski resorts. The defining feature here, in contrast to undifferentiated Bertrand competition, is the unique characteristics of each product. To be part of this competitive landscape, the market must exhibit the following criteria:\n\nA Few, Influential Firms: These firms have the power to shape market equilibrium and influence their competitors’ strategies.\nProduct Differentiation: Products are distinct in the eyes of consumers, who may prefer one over another based on these differences.\nEntry Barriers: These maintain the concentration of key players in the industry.\nNumerous, Individual Customers: A large customer base with limited individual market influence.\nPerfect Information: All parties are well-informed about product prices and availability.\nPrice Competition: Despite product differentiation, pricing remains a crucial competitive tool.\n\n\nDifferentiation and the Dynamics of Pricing\nDifferentiated Bertrand markets allow firms to command higher, more sustainable prices, thanks to the unique appeal of their products. For instance, consider two firms offering similar but distinct products, each enjoying its own loyal customer base. A scenario where one firm offers its product for free doesn’t automatically mean the other loses all its customers. Brand loyalty and product preferences ensure that some customers remain willing to pay a premium.\nIn this market, firms lose the typical price war incentives seen in undifferentiated scenarios. Unique product attributes allow firms to adjust their pricing strategies flexibly. If one firm raises its price, its competitor might also increase its price, potentially adding a premium for its distinct features. This pricing interplay continues until reaching a threshold where customers no longer perceive additional value in paying a higher price.\n\n\nDifferentiated Bertrand Equilibrium\nIn differentiated Bertrand oligopolies, products are distinct yet substitutable, catering to the diverse needs of heterogeneous customers. This scenario is typical in industries where strategic pricing and product uniqueness play pivotal roles.\n\nDemand Curves for Differentiated Products\nHere, the customer’s perception of products directly influences demand. The general demand equations for two competing firms in such a market can be expressed as:\n\nFirm 1: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{Q_1 = a_1 + b_1 P_1 + b_{12}P_2}\\)\nFirm 2: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{Q_2 = a_2 + b_2 P_2 + b_{21}P_1}\\)\n\nIn these equations, \\(\\mathsf{Q_1}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{Q_2}\\) denote the demand for Firm 1 and Firm 2, respectively, while \\(\\mathsf{P_1}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{P_2}\\) are their corresponding prices. The coefficients \\(\\mathsf{a_1}\\), \\(\\mathsf{b_1}\\), and \\(\\mathsf{b_{12}}\\) (and their Firm 2 counterparts) represent the demand intercept, slope, and cross-price effect, illustrating how each firm’s demand is affected by both its own and its competitor’s pricing.\n\n\nMaximizing Profits with Differentiation\nProfit maximization for each firm involves finding the optimal price that balances revenue and costs. The profit functions are:\n\nFirm 1: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{\\pi_{1} = P_{1}Q_{1} - f_{1} - c_{1}Q_{1}}\\)\nFirm 2: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{\\pi_{2} = P_{2}Q_{2} - f_{2} - c_{2}Q_{2}}\\)\n\nWhere \\(\\mathsf{\\pi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{\\pi_{2}}\\) represent the profits, incorporating both fixed (\\(\\mathsf{f}\\)) and variable unit costs (\\(\\mathsf{c}\\)). Substituting the demand equations into the profit functions, we get:\n\nFirm 1: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{\\pi_1 = P_{1}(a_{1} - b_{1}P_{1}+b_{12}P_{2}) - f_{1} - c_{1}(a_{1} - b_{1}P_{1}+b_{12}P_{2})}\\).\nFirm 2: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{\\pi_2 = P_{2}(a_{2} - b_{2}P_{2}+b_{21}P_{1}) - f_{2} - c_{2}(a_{2} - b_{2}P_{2}+b_{21}P_{1}) }\\).\n\n\n\nReaction Functions\nEach differentiated Bertrand oligopolist’s pricing decision is intertwined with its competitor’s pricing strategy. The relationship between the company’s optimal price and the competitor’s price is captured in reaction functions which map out the optimal pricing response to every possible competitor price.\nFirm 1’s Reaction: Illustrated in Fig. R1, showing how its optimal price adjusts in response to Firm 2’s pricing. Firm 2’s Reaction: Similarly, Firm 2’s optimal pricing, in response to Firm 1’s strategy, is also defined by a reaction function.\nCompany 1’s reaction function showing how its optimal price adjusts in response to Firm 2’s pricing is illustrated in Figure 10.1. The intercept shows that if Company 2 sets price at zero, Company 1 would still set its price above zero. The slope shows that Company 1 will optimally raise its price when Company 2 raises its price. In short, this reaction function demonstrates that each firm’s optimal price is a strategic response to its competitor’s pricing, leading to a state of mutual dependency. For Company 1, the only remaining question is “what price will Company 2 choose?”\n\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\na1 &lt;- 100\na2 &lt;- a1\n#\nb1 &lt;- -2\nb2 &lt;- b1\n#\nb12 &lt;- 1\nb21 &lt;- b12\n#\nc1 &lt;- 4\nc2 &lt;- c1\n#\nf1 &lt;- 500\nf2 &lt;- f1\n#\nfQ1 &lt;- function(P1,P2) a1 + b1*P1 + b12*P2\nfQ2 &lt;- function(P2,P1) a2 + b2*P2 + b21*P1\n#\nfR1 &lt;- function(P1,P2) P1 * fQ1(P1,P2)\nfR2 &lt;- function(P2,P1) P2 * fQ2(P2,P1)\n#\nfr1 &lt;- function(P2)  ( (b1*c1 - a1) / (2*b1) ) - ( P2 * (b12 / 2*b1) )\nfr2 &lt;- function(P1)  ( (b2*c2 - a2) / (2*b2) ) - ( P1 * (b21 / 2*b2) )\nfr2_inv &lt;- function(P2)  ( (b1*c1 - a1) / (b12) ) - ( P2 * (2*b1 / b12) )\n#\nrev_bounds &lt;- tibble(x = c(0, 100))    # Create tibble containing plot range for x-axis (P)\neqn1 &lt;- \" P[1] == frac(b[1] * c[1] - a[1], 2*b[1]) - frac(b[12],2*b[1]) * ~~ P[2] \"\nggplot(rev_bounds, aes(x)) +                     # Draw ggplot2 plot\n  #\n#  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = 0, yend = 200), color = \"black\", linewidth=0.125) + \n  geom_function(fun = fr1, color = \"IndianRed\", linewidth = 2) +\n#  geom_function(fun = fr2, color = \"Salmon\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Prices of Company 2\",\n       y = \"Prices of Company 1\") +\n  #\n  #geom_text(x=100, y=80, label=eqn1, hjust = 1, size = 4, parse=TRUE) +\n  geom_text(x=80, y=82, label=\"Reaction Function of\\n Company 1\", hjust = .50, size = 4, parse=F) +\n#  geom_text(x=80, y=50, label=\"(Company 1's optimal price in response\\n to prices of Company 2)\", hjust = .50, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  #\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Remove X axis labels\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),  # Remove Y axis labels\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()    # Remove tick marks for both axes\n  ) +\n  #scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  scale_y_continuous(lim = c(-0,150), labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  theme_hc() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Reaction function for Company 1 – Company 1’s optimal prices as its best response to every possible price from Company 2\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might already be anticipating that Company 2, much like Company 1, has its own reaction function, dependent on the pricing decisions of Company 1. This interdependence raises an intriguing question: “What price will Company 1 choose?” Logically, we are left with a strategic stalemate with both companies waiting for their competitor act so they can respond with their best price. Fortunately, there is a simple solution to the mutually dependent pricing conundrum.\nFigure 10.2 introduces the reaction function of Company 2 alongside that of Company 1, providing a comprehensive view of their interactive pricing strategies. Observing Company 2’s reaction function, we notice that if Company 1 were to set its price at zero, Company 2 would still opt for a price above zero, as indicated by its reaction function’s intercept on the x-axis. Moreover, the positive slope of Company 2’s reaction function suggests a strategic response pattern: as Company 1 increases its price, Company 2 will also elevate its price proportionally.\nThis addition of Company 2’s reaction function to the plot not only enriches our understanding of the market dynamics but also sets the stage for identifying the equilibrium point where both companies’ strategies converge.\n\nrev_bounds &lt;- tibble(x = c(0, 100))    # Create tibble containing plot range for x-axis (P)\neqn1 &lt;- \" P[1] == frac(b[1] * c[1] - a[1], 2*b[1]) - frac(b[12],2*b[1]) * ~~ P[2] \"\nggplot(rev_bounds, aes(x)) +                     # Draw ggplot2 plot\n  #\n#  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = 0, yend = 200), color = \"black\", linewidth=0.125) + \n  geom_function(fun = fr1, color = \"IndianRed\", linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_function(fun = fr2_inv, color = \"Salmon\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Prices of Company 2\",\n       y = \"Prices of Company 1\") +\n  #\n  #geom_text(x=100, y=80, label=eqn1, hjust = 1, size = 4, parse=TRUE) +\n  geom_text(x=80, y=82, label=\"Reaction Function of\\n Company 1\", hjust = .50, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=45, y=130, label=\"Reaction Function of\\n Company 2\", hjust = .50, size = 4, parse=F) +\n#  geom_text(x=80, y=50, label=\"(Company 1's optimal price in response\\n to prices of Company 2)\", hjust = .50, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  #\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Remove X axis labels\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),  # Remove Y axis labels\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()    # Remove tick marks for both axes\n  ) +\n  #scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  scale_y_continuous(lim = c(-0,150), labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  theme_hc() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Reaction functions for Company 1 and Company 2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2 not only illustrates the individual reaction functions of Companies 1 and 2 but also reveals a critical intersection point between them. This intersection signifies where each company’s optimal pricing strategy, or best response, aligns with the other’s. In seeking to optimize, both companies naturally gravitate towards setting their prices on their reaction functions. The convergence of these functions at a single point highlights the only scenario where both firms can simultaneously choose their best responses. This point of intersection defines the optimal, equilibrium prices in our differentiated Bertrand oligopoly, as depicted in Figure 10.3.\nThe emergence of this equilibrium, however, raises a pertinent question: How do Bertrand competitors, without any coordination, arrive at the equilibrium prices where their reaction functions intersect? While it’s conceivable that both firms could analytically deduce and simultaneously choose the exact equilibrium prices, real-world evidence suggests this is not commonly the case.\nIn practice, firms often reach the Bertrand equilibrium through a process of observation and reaction. Take, for instance, Company 2 setting its initial price at zero as depicted in Figure 10.3. In response, Company 1 would set its price at the intercept of its reaction function. Company 2, observing this, adjusts its price upward to align with its reaction function, as indicated by the bottom arrow in Figure 10.3. This iterative process, characterized by a series of adjustments and counter-adjustments, eventually leads the firms to converge at the equilibrium. The key is consistent observation and responsive action, ensuring that each firm continually adjusts its pricing in line with the evolving market dynamics.\n\nfr1_0 &lt;- fr1(0)\nfr2_27 &lt;- fr2(fr1_0)\n#fr1(45.5)\nrev_bounds &lt;- tibble(x = c(0, 100))    # Create tibble containing plot range for x-axis (P)\neqn1 &lt;- \" P[1] == frac(b[1] * c[1] - a[1], 2*b[1]) - frac(b[12],2*b[1]) * ~~ P[2] \"\nggplot(rev_bounds, aes(x)) +                     # Draw ggplot2 plot\n  #\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = fr1(45.48), xend = 45.48, yend = fr1(45.48)), linetype=\"dotted\", color = \"black\", linewidth=0.5) +  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 45.2, y = 0, xend = 45.2, yend = fr1(45.2)), linetype=\"dotted\", color = \"black\", linewidth=0.5) +\n  #\n  geom_segment(aes(x=0.5, y=0, xend = 0.5, yend=(fr1(0) - 2)), arrow = arrow(length=unit(.25, 'cm')), color='black', lwd=.5) +  \n  geom_segment(aes(x=0, y=fr1(0), xend=33, yend=fr1(0)), arrow = arrow(length=unit(.25, 'cm')),               color='black', lwd=.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=33.3, y=fr1(0), xend=33.3, yend=fr1(33.3)-2), arrow = arrow(length=unit(.25, 'cm')),               color='black', lwd=.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=33.3, y=fr1(33), xend=41, yend=fr1(33)), arrow = arrow(length=unit(.25, 'cm')),               color='black', lwd=.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=41.5, y=fr1(33), xend=41.5, yend=fr1(41.5)-2), arrow = arrow(length=unit(.25, 'cm')),               color='black', lwd=.5) +  \n  #\n  geom_function(fun = fr1, color = \"IndianRed\", linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_function(fun = fr2_inv, color = \"Salmon\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Prices of Company 2\",\n       y = \"Prices of Company 1\") +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=80, y=82, label=\"Reaction Function of\\n Company 1\", hjust = .50, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=45, y=130, label=\"Reaction Function of\\n Company 2\", hjust = .50, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=25, y=90, label=\"Bertrand Equilibrium\", hjust = .50, size = 5, parse=F) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=40, y=85, xend=44, yend=74), arrow = arrow(length=unit(.25, 'cm')),               color='black', lwd=.5) +  \n  #\n  geom_text(x=1.25, y=78, aes(label = \"P[1]\"), hjust = .50, size = 5, parse=TRUE) +\n  geom_text(x=48.5, y=5, label=\"P[2]\", hjust = .50, size = 5, parse=TRUE) +\n  #\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Remove X axis labels\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),  # Remove Y axis labels\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()    # Remove tick marks for both axes\n  ) +\n  #scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  scale_y_continuous(lim = c(-0,150), labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  theme_hc() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Reaction functions for Company 1 and Company 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBertrand-Nash Equilibrium\n\n\n\nThis logic of both companies choosing their best response to their competitor is known as a Nash equilibrium.6 Since we are seeking the equilibrium prices in a differentiated Bertrand oligopoly, this equilibrium is known as a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium or the Bertrand equilibrium for short.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Example: Coke v. Pepsi in Bertrand Competition\nCoca-Cola and Pepsi, two of the most iconic soft drink brands, exemplify the dynamics of differentiated Bertrand competition. Utilizing demand and cost curves estimated from historical data,1 we can delve into their competitive strategies and profitability within the Bertrand framework.\nLet’s designate Coca-Cola as Company \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) and Pepsi as Company \\(\\mathsf{p}\\). Their respective demand curves have been estimated as7\n\nCoke’s demand curve: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad Q_c = 63.42 - 3.98\\ P_c + 2.25\\ P_p}\\)\nPepsi’s demand curve: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad Q_p = 49.52 - 5.48\\ P_p + 1.40\\ P_c}\\)\n\nThese demand curves suggest a scenario where a price increase by Coke (Company \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)) relative to Pepsi (Company \\(\\mathsf{p}\\)) would reduce Coke’s sales, but not all Coke consumers would switch to Pepsi. This reflects the brand loyalty found among consumers of differentiated products.\nThe estimated variable unit costs for Coke and Pepsi are:\n\nCoke’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_c = \\$4.96}\\)\nPepsi’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_p = \\$3.96}\\)\n\nIncorporating these costs into the demand functions, we derive the profit functions for each company:\n\nCoke’s profit: \\(\\mathsf{ \\quad \\pi_c = (P_c - c_c) (63.42 - 3.98\\ P_c + 2.25\\ P_p) }\\)\nPepsi’s profit: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad \\pi_p = (P_p - c_p) (49.52 - 5.48\\ P_p + 1.40\\ P_c)}\\)\n\nNext, we determine the reaction functions for each company:\n\nCoke’s reaction function: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad P_c = 10.45 + 0.2827\\ P_p}\\)\nPepsi’s reaction function: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad P_p = 6.498 + 0.1277\\ P_c}\\)\n\nFigure 10.4 illustrates these reaction functions and the Bertrand equilibrium optimal prices for Coke and Pepsi.

    "text": "10.5 Conclusion\nAs we conclude our exploration of Bertrand oligopolies and their implications for entrepreneurial ventures, several critical lessons emerge. These lessons are not just theoretical musings but practical guidelines for navigating the complex landscape of market competition.\n\nExercise Pricing Discipline\nOne of the most important takeaways is the concept of pricing mutual forbearance. In the relentless quest to attract customers, the temptation to engage in aggressive price cutting can be strong. However, our analysis underscores the peril of this approach, particularly in undifferentiated markets. Instead, firms must practice restraint and avoid triggering destructive price wars that erode profitability for all players involved. Recognizing and respecting the pricing strategies of competitors can lead to a more stable and sustainable competitive environment.\n\n\nThe Significance of Product Differentiation\nDifferentiated Bertrand competition highlights the value of product differentiation and the discipline it brings to pricing strategies. Differentiation allows firms to escape the trap of competing solely on price, enabling them to command premium prices for unique product features that resonate with specific customer segments. This approach not only helps in maintaining healthy profit margins but also fosters innovation and brand loyalty.\n\n\nMeasure Competitiveness for Evidence-Based Decisions\nFinally, the ability to compete effectively is not a matter of guesswork. It requires a rigorous measurement of expected profits and a deep understanding of one’s competitive position. In the realm of entrepreneurship, where resources are often limited and the cost of missteps high, making evidence-based decisions is crucial. By quantitatively assessing how well a venture can compete against its rivals, entrepreneurs can make informed strategic choices, from pricing to product development.\nIn conclusion, the journey through the nuances of Bertrand oligopolies reveals much about the strategic underpinnings of effective competition. For entrepreneurs, the lessons learned here are invaluable. They provide a framework for understanding market dynamics, a guide for strategic decision-making, and a reminder of the importance of innovation and customer focus. By applying these insights, entrepreneurs can navigate the competitive landscape with greater confidence and precision, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and success.",

    "text": "10.6 Workout Problems\n\nDorsal Packs\nA group of entrepreneurs, concerned about pick-pocketing in tourist destinations, created the Dorsal travel pack. This stylish, modern backpack has zippers facing inward, toward the back of the wearer, for security. For added security, it is made of slash-resistant fabric in nondescript colors to avoid the attention that more colorful, fashion-oriented brands draw.\nThe team validated the problem and solution, refined the concept, and confirmed direct sales through their website. They conducted a profitability analysis with 107 potential customers, who rated the innovation, suggested improvements, stated their maximum willingness to pay, and provided travel and demographic information.\nThe team recognizes that not all travelers care more strongly about security than other features the bag may have. They have seen competitors in the market that focus on the versatility in of a travel pack, emphasizing pockets, packing, and compatability with airline luggage restrictions, in addition to branded logos and colors. The VersaPack travel pack is the dominant competitor in the travel pack market, primarily targeting travelers who value versatility by designing and placing pockets in convenient places, enhancing packability, and developing TSA-friendly features. While the VersaPack is less secure from pick-pocketers than the Dorsal pack, it has many features that travelers value.\nHow effectively can Dorsal pack expect to compete with VersaPack. What is the impact on Dorsal pack’s predicted profits when we add a competitor to the analytics?\n\nDorsal Pack data\nThe Dorsal pack team reached out to travelers who have either traveled internationally recently or are about to travel internationally. They showed the travelers both the Dorsal pack and the VersaPack and gathered data about their impressions and willingness to pay.

Their total cost curve is linear: \\(\\mathsf{C = cQ + f}\\) where \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is the variable cost per unit and \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is fixed cost per month.\n\n\nRescaling\nTo conduct profitability analytics, it’s crucial to align the scale of sample demand with the fixed costs required to serve the market. For this analysis, we will rescale the demand up to the market level. Concerning market size:\n\nInternational Travelers from the U.S.: According to the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office, approximately 93 million international trips were made by U.S. citizens in 2019. We focus on 2019 data because international travel dynamics significantly changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent recovery data is not yet fully available.\n\nWe estimate that the average international traveler makes about 1.5 trips per year, accounting for both frequent travelers and those who rarely travel abroad.\nIt is generally estimated that 70 to 80 percent of these trips are for leisure purposes.\nCombining these factors, we assume there were approximately 43.4 million unique international travelers in 2019.\n\nPercentage of Young Travelers Likely to Use a Backpack: While detailed data is unavailable, a conservative estimate suggests that 25% of these travelers are in the 20-39 age group, a demographic typically more active in international travel. This estimation brings our target population down to 10.85 million.\nMarket share in a crowded backpack market: Recognizing the diverse needs and preferences of travelers, as well as the crowded nature of the backpack market, achieving a 1-5% market share would be substantial. Opting for a midpoint estimate of 3%, we approximate the target market to be around 65,100 potential customers.\n\nIn summary, our assumption for the target market is about 565,500 potential international travelers, some of whom care more about security and others who care more about versatility.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat is the rescaling factor \\(\\mathsf{m}\\) based on the calculation of the target population?\nHow many Dorsal travel packs would you expect to sell to the sample of 97 respondents if the price of a Dorsal pack is $200 and the price of a VersaPack is $150?\nHow many VersaPack travel packs would you expect to sell to the sample of 97 respondents if the price of a VersaPack is $200 and the price of a Dorsal travel pack is $175?\nHow many Dorsal travel packs would you expect to sell to the complete market if the price of a Dorsal pack is $250 and the price of a VersaPack is $200?\nHow many VersaPack travel packs would you expect to sell to the complete market if the price of a VersaPack is $220 and the price of a Dorsal travel pack is $150?\nUsing an iterating function or manual iteration, what is the differentiated Bertrand equilibrium price for a Dorsal pack? Use the rescaled market demand curve for your calculation and continue to use the market demand for the rest of the questions.\nWhat is the differentiated Bertrand equilibrium price for a VersaPack travel pack?\nHow many Dorsal travel packs would you expect to sell to the complete market at the Bertrand equilibrium prices?\nHow many VersaPack travel packs would you expect to sell to the complete market at the Bertrand equilibrium prices?\nHow much profit does Dorsal pack expect to earn per year in competition with VersaPack?\nHow much profit does VersaPack expect to earn per year in competition with Dorsal pack?\nDoes Dorsal pack expect to earn more profit or less in competition with VersaPack compared to what it expected to earn under the assumption it was a monopolist?\nWhich market assumption is more appropriate (monopoly or Bertrand competition)?\nHow does Dorsal pack’s expected profit change when considering only the responses of customers who value security highly (security preference score of 7 or higher)?\nIs Dorsal a stronger competitor (higher expected profit) with customers who care about more about security or with all travelers?\n\n\n\n\n\nChristensen, Clayton M., and Michael E.

    "text": "Entry Barriers in Practice\nWhile entry barriers pose significant challenges to entrepreneurs, they also serve as protective moats for incumbents. These barriers can manifest in various forms, from cost advantages to customer loyalty and market control.\n\n\nTwo Main Types of Entry Barriers\n\nCost-Based Barriers: These barriers are often rooted in economic advantages that established companies hold over new entrants. They include:\n\nEconomies of Scale: Larger firms can spread their costs over a greater number of products, allowing them to offer lower prices.\nLearning Curves (Learning by Doing): Established firms gain efficiency and cost advantages over time as they refine their processes and operations. This learning effect can create a significant barrier for new entrants who start at a higher cost base.\nAccess to Proprietary Technologies: Exclusive technologies or processes can give incumbents a distinct cost advantage that is hard for new entrants to replicate.\n\nMarket Share-Based Barriers: These barriers arise from the established market position of incumbents and include:\n\nBrand Loyalty: Strong brand recognition and customer loyalty can make it difficult for new entrants to attract customers.\nExclusive Partnerships and Agreements: Deals with suppliers, distributors, or other stakeholders can create a network that is difficult for newcomers to penetrate.\nControl Over Distribution Channels: Ownership or control over key distribution channels can prevent new entrants from accessing the market effectively.\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Amazon’s E-Commerce Supremacy\nAmazon’s rise to e-commerce supremacy is a prime example of how incumbents use entry barriers to maintain their market position. Their journey offers valuable lessons in the strategic use of multiple entry barriers.\nBuilding Economies of Scale: Amazon started as a modest online bookstore but quickly expanded its product range. This expansion allowed Amazon to build economies of scale, lowering operational costs and enabling competitive pricing that new entrants find hard to match.\nBrand Loyalty and Trust: Over the years, Amazon has cultivated strong customer loyalty through consistent service quality, vast product selection, and customer-centric policies like easy returns. This brand loyalty acts as a significant barrier for new companies trying to persuade customers to switch.\nTechnology and Data Analytics: Amazon’s sophisticated use of data analytics and technology in logistics, product recommendations, and customer experience sets a high standard. Their technological infrastructure provides a cost and efficiency advantage that is a formidable challenge for new entrants.\nControl Over Distribution Networks: Amazon’s vast distribution network, including a mix of fulfillment centers and partnerships, ensures fast and efficient delivery. Their control over these channels presents a significant hurdle for newcomers who lack the infrastructure to compete on delivery times.\nInnovation and Diversification: Amazon continually innovates, venturing into new markets like cloud computing (AWS) and digital streaming (Amazon Prime Video). This diversification strategy keeps them ahead and presents varied challenges for entrants in different sectors.\nUtilizing Marketplace Dynamics: Amazon Marketplace has become a platform for third-party sellers, further entrenching Amazon’s position. While it offers opportunities for small businesses, it also reinforces Amazon’s market dominance as they control the platform and gather valuable data.\nThrough these strategies, Amazon has not only protected its position but has continued to expand its influence across various markets. Their approach demonstrates the multifaceted nature of entry barriers and how an incumbent can effectively leverage them to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nFor entrepreneurs, understanding these barriers is vital to strategize effectively for market entry. It’s about identifying not just the gaps in the market but also considering how to navigate or leverage these entrenched barriers to carve out a viable space for your business.",

    "text": "11.2 Overcoming Entry Barriers\n\nInnovative Approaches for Entrepreneurs\nBreaking into well-guarded markets requires creativity, persistence, and strategic thinking. Here, we explore various methods that entrepreneurs have successfully used to overcome daunting entry barriers. While these strategies are inspired by various sources,1 they are tailored to fit the modern entrepreneurial landscape.\n\nFinding Niche Markets: Often, the key to entering a market with high barriers is to start small. Target a niche market that the big players have overlooked or considered too insignificant to pursue. This approach allows you to establish a foothold without directly confronting larger incumbents.\nLeveraging Technology and Innovation: Use technology and innovation to create a unique value proposition. This could involve developing a new product, a disruptive business model, or a technological breakthrough that changes the rules of the game.\nBuilding Strategic Partnerships: Forming alliances or partnerships can provide access to essential resources, distribution networks, or market insights. Partnerships, especially with established players, can lend credibility and reduce the perceived risk by potential customers.\nUtilizing Regulatory Changes: Stay attuned to regulatory changes that might level the playing field. For instance, new regulations may open up previously inaccessible markets or impose constraints on incumbents that newcomers can exploit.\nFocus on Customer Experience: Differentiate yourself by offering an exceptional customer experience. This can include superior service, user-friendly interfaces, or personalized offerings that incumbents may not provide.\nCrowdfunding and Community Support: Utilize crowdfunding platforms to not only raise capital but also to build a community of supporters. This can validate your product in the market and generate early buzz.\nAgile and Lean Start-Up Approaches: Embrace agility and the lean start-up methodology to quickly adapt to market feedback, pivot when necessary, and innovate continuously. This agility can be a significant advantage over larger, less flexible incumbents.\n\n\n\nCase Study: Tesla’s Market Entry Strategy\nTesla’s foray into the automotive industry is a textbook example of overcoming substantial entry barriers with a blend of innovative strategies. Facing formidable challenges such as the high development costs of electric vehicle (EV) technology and the entrenched brand loyalty of established automotive giants, Tesla charted its own path to success.\nKey to Tesla’s strategy was their focus on initially targeting a niche market of high-end electric vehicles. This allowed them to build a strong brand without directly confronting larger incumbents. They then expanded their reach, using their established reputation as a launchpad.\nInnovation was at the heart of Tesla’s approach. They leveraged cutting-edge technology to create vehicles that stood out from traditional options, both in terms of performance and environmental impact. This focus on innovation extended to their business model as well; their direct-to-consumer sales approach disrupted the traditional dealership model, reconfiguring the automotive value chain.\nTesla also capitalized on government incentives for EVs, which helped offset the high initial costs and made their cars more accessible to a broader market.\nMoreover, Tesla placed a strong emphasis on customer experience, from the design of their cars to their unique marketing strategies and customer service. This focus helped them cultivate a loyal customer base and distinguish themselves in a crowded market.\nThrough these strategies, Tesla didn’t just manage to enter the automotive industry; they transformed it, highlighting how a deep understanding and strategic navigation of entry barriers can not only facilitate market entry but also create a lasting competitive edge.",

    "text": "11.3 Leveraging Entry Barriers for Competitive Advantage\n\nCreating and Strengthening Entry Barriers to Close the Door Behind You\nOnce you’ve successfully entered a market, the next strategic move is to ‘close the door behind you.’ This means creating or strengthening entry barriers to secure your market position and deter potential competitors. Here are key strategies to consider:\n\nProduct Differentiation: Differentiate your product or service to create a unique market position. This can involve innovation in design, features, or technology that sets your offering apart. Product differentiation makes it harder for new entrants to offer a comparable alternative that attracts your customer base.\nIntellectual Property (IP) Protection: Secure your innovations legally. Patents, trademarks, and copyrights can provide legal barriers to entry, protecting your unique products, services, or even branding from being replicated by competitors.\nScaling Effectively: As your business grows, aim to achieve economies of scale. This means optimizing your operations to lower costs as your production volume increases. Economies of scale can act as a barrier by making it financially challenging for new entrants to compete at the same cost level.\nBuilding Brand Loyalty: Invest in building a strong brand. Customer loyalty is a powerful barrier to entry, as it requires new competitors to overcome the trust and recognition you’ve established with your market.\nExclusive Partnerships and Agreements: Establish exclusive partnerships with suppliers, distributors, or other key stakeholders. Such agreements can limit the access new entrants have to essential resources or market channels.\nContinual Innovation: Stay ahead of the curve by continually innovating. This could mean regularly updating your product line, adopting new technologies, or finding novel ways to enhance customer experience.\n\n\n\nCase Study: Apple’s Strategic Defense Through Entry Barriers\nApple Inc.’s journey in securing its market position is a masterclass in effectively leveraging entry barriers. From its early days to its current status as a tech giant, Apple has consistently employed a range of strategies to ‘close the door’ behind them.\n\nEarly Strategies for Market Protection\n\nInnovative Product Design and User Experience: In the early years, Apple set itself apart with the Macintosh, which offered a unique user interface vastly different from the prevailing command-line interfaces. This focus on intuitive design and user experience became a hallmark of Apple’s product differentiation.\nBuilding a Robust Ecosystem: Apple began creating an integrated ecosystem with the launch of iTunes and the iPod. This ecosystem strategy, expanded later with the iPhone and App Store, created a seamless experience for users, significantly raising entry barriers for competitors.\n\n\n\nOngoing Strategies to Maintain Market Position\n\nIntellectual Property (IP) Vigilance: Apple has aggressively protected its innovations through patents and trademarks. This IP strategy includes iconic designs and functionalities, creating legal hurdles for competitors attempting to replicate their success.\nBrand Building and Loyalty: Apple’s brand, symbolizing innovation, quality, and exclusivity, has cultivated a loyal customer base. Their brand loyalty is a significant barrier, making it challenging for new entrants to sway Apple’s customers.\nScaling with Supply Chain Mastery: As Apple grew, they mastered supply chain efficiencies, achieving economies of scale that allow them to price competitively, despite their premium positioning. This scale makes it challenging for new entrants to match their price and quality.\nExclusive Partnerships: Apple has formed strategic partnerships, like their exclusive contracts with certain component suppliers and major telecom companies for iPhone distribution, restricting competitors’ access to these resources.\nContinued Innovation and Diversification: Apple’s continuous innovation, seen in their consistent updates to existing products and expansion into new markets like wearable technology and services, keeps them ahead of potential entrants.\n\n\n\nThe Cumulative Effect\nThese strategies have created a cumulative effect, fortifying Apple’s position against new entrants. From the Macintosh’s early breakthrough to the iPhone’s revolutionary impact and beyond, Apple’s journey demonstrates a multi-faceted approach to leveraging entry barriers, ensuring their market dominance throughout different technology eras.",

    "text": "12.1 Rethinking Market Size: A Shift Towards Profitability Analysis\nThe Traditional Approach: Market Size Estimates\nIn both corporate and entrepreneurial settings, market size estimates are traditionally used to gauge the profit potential of investments in innovation. The idea is simple: a larger market size suggests greater profit opportunities if a product gains a certain market share. This method, however, relies heavily on hypothetical scenarios and often overlooks crucial factors like market share attainability and industry entry barriers.\nThe Limitations of Market Size as a Profit Proxy\nMarket size, while indicative, isn’t always a reliable proxy for profitability. For example, a sizable market like the cola industry may seem lucrative, but high entry barriers can drastically limit market share for new entrants. Existing measures like Total Addressable Market (TAM),1 Serviceable Available Market (SAM),2 and Target Market,3 though refined, still fall short because they don’t fully account for the dynamics of market entry, especially for market makers who are creating new segments.\nA More Direct Approach: Estimating Profitability Through Customer Demand\nA more direct and informative approach involves estimating the demand curve specific to the innovation. This method integrates customer pain points with the effectiveness of the proposed solution. A larger target market, better solution efficacy, and greater differentiation from existing products all contribute to higher expected profitability. This approach, grounded in differentiated Bertrand oligopoly models, allows for the calculation of equilibrium prices, quantities, market shares, and profits, providing a more accurate and actionable profitability estimate.",

    "text": "Understanding Profit as a Truer Measure of Market Potential\nRevenue vs. Profit: Shifting the Focus\nTraditional market size metrics, like total addressable market, often emphasize total sales value. While this offers a sense of the revenue pool, it doesn’t necessarily reflect a company’s profitability. By using demand and profit functions, we can calculate expected revenue as a market size measure but with a crucial distinction - our primary focus is on profit maximization, not just revenue.\nProfit: A More Relevant Indicator for Investment Decisions\nInvestors typically rely on revenue proxies to gauge profit potential. However, actual profit figures provide a more accurate and meaningful measure for investment decisions. As our earlier calculations showed, understanding the profit per company helps in determining the viability of investment and continued operation.\nProfit as a Predictor of Long-Term Success\nIt’s important to note that these profitability estimates reflect a scenario where the product is well-known, resembling its mature market stage. This perspective aligns well with traditional market size metrics but offers a more realistic and actionable forecast for long-term success.\n\n\nProfitability in Practice: An Illustrative Case\nUnderstanding Demand Curves and Profit Functions\nConsider a scenario in a differentiated Bertrand oligopoly involving two companies. Their demand curves and profit functions can be mathematically expressed, leading to reaction functions that help determine optimized equilibrium prices, quantities, and profits. This mathematical approach, while intricate, offers a tangible way to predict market behavior and profitability.\nLet’s apply this to a hypothetical situation where two companies with identical costs and differentiation exist in a market. Using specific parameters, we can calculate equilibrium outcomes, providing insights into potential revenues and profits. The demand curves are\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{Q_1} &= \\mathsf{a_1 - b_1\\ P_1 + b_{12}\\ P_2} \\\\[6pt]\n\\mathsf{Q_2} &= \\mathsf{a_2 - b_2\\ P_2 + b_{21}\\ P_1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere ai is the intercept of Company i, bi is the “own price” slope of Company i, and bij is the “competitor price” slope (the substitution effect of the price of Company j) for the product of Company i.\nFrom these demand curves, we get profit functions for both Companies:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{\\pi_1} &= \\mathsf{(P_1 - c_1)\\ Q_1 - f_1} \\\\[5pt]\n               &= \\mathsf{(P_1 - c_1)\\ (a_1 - b_1\\ P_1 + b_{12}\\ P_2) - f_1} \\\\[15pt]\n\\mathsf{\\pi_2} &= \\mathsf{(P_2 - c_2)\\ (a_2 - b_2\\ P_2 + b_{21}\\ P_1) - f_2}\n\\end{align}\n\\] where ci is the variable cost per unit of Company i and fi is the fixed cost of Company i.\nMaximizing profit generates reaction functions that we solve either iteratively or as a system of equations to find the differentiated Bertrand equilibrium prices, quantities, and profits. Skipping the math, the formula for the optimized equilibrium prices is\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{P_1^*} &= \\mathsf{\\frac{-2 a_1 b_2 + 2 b_1 b_2 c_1 + a_2 b_{21} - b_2 b_{21} c_2}\n                     {4 b_1 b_2 - b_{12} b_{2}}} \\\\[16pt]\n\n\\mathsf{P_2^*} &= \\mathsf{\\frac{-2 a_2 b_1 + 2 b_2 b_1 c_2 + a_1 b_{12} - b_1 b_{12} c_1}\n                     {4 b_2 b_1 - b_{21} b_{12}}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThese optimal price formulas allow us to quickly calculate prices, quantities, and profits. Let’s do that for a particular set of parameters. Make two companies that are equally differentiated and have identical costs:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{a_1} &= \\mathsf{a_2 = 100} \\\\\n\\mathsf{b_1} &= \\mathsf{b_2 = 2} \\\\\n\\mathsf{b_{12}} &= \\mathsf{b_{21} = 1} \\\\\n\\mathsf{c_1} &= \\mathsf{c_2 = 25}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n# firm 1\na_1 &lt;- 100\nb_1 &lt;- -2\nb_12 &lt;- 1\nc_1 &lt;- 25\n\n# firm 2\na_2 &lt;- 100\nb_2 &lt;- -2\nb_21 &lt;- 1\nc_2 &lt;- 25\n\n\nfP1_star &lt;- function(a1, a2, b1, b2, b12, b21, c1, c2) {(-2*a1*b2 + 2*b1*b2*c1 + a2*b21 - b2*b21*c2) / (4*b1*b2 - b21*b12)}\nfP2_star &lt;- function(a1, a2, b1, b2, b12, b21, c1, c2) {(-2*a2*b1 + 2*b2*b1*c2 + a1*b12 - b1*b12*c1) / (4*b2*b1 - b12*b21)}\n#\nP1_star &lt;- fP1_star(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, b_12, b_21, c_1, c_2) # 50\nP2_star &lt;- fP2_star(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, b_12, b_21, c_1, c_2) # 50\n\n\nfQ1_star &lt;- function(P1, P2) { a_1 + b_1 * P1 + b_12 * P2}\nfQ2_star &lt;- function(P1, P2) { a_2 + b_2 * P2 + b_21 * P1}\n#\nQ1_star &lt;- fQ1_star(P1_star, P2_star) # 50\nQ2_star &lt;- fQ2_star(P1_star, P2_star) # 50\n\n\nfPi1_star &lt;- function(P1,P2) { (P1 - c_1) * fQ1_star(P1,P2) }\nfPi2_star &lt;- function(P1,P2) { (P2 - c_2) * fQ2_star(P1,P2) }\n#\n#ggplot() + xlim(0,100) + ylim(0,1250) +   geom_function(fun = fPi1_star, args = list(P2 = 50), color = \"green4\", linewidth = 2)\n#\nPi1_star &lt;- fPi1_star(P1_star, P2_star) # 1250\nPi2_star &lt;- fPi2_star(P2_star, P1_star) # 1250\n\nWith these parameters, we can calculate that the equilibrium outcome is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{P_1^*} &= \\mathsf{P_2^* = 50} \\\\[3pt]\n\\mathsf{Q_1^*} &= \\mathsf{Q_2^* = 50} \\\\[3pt]\n\\mathsf{\\pi_1^*} &= \\mathsf{\\pi_2^* = 1250}\n\\end{align}\n\\] ### Revenue as Market Size: Traditional vs. Analytical Perspectives\nTraditional View: Total Sales Value as Market Size Indicator\nTraditionally, market size metrics like Total Addressable Market focus on the total value of sales in the market. This approach provides an overview of the available revenue pool for companies. It’s a straightforward method to gauge market potential but doesn’t necessarily reflect a company’s true profit potential.\nAnalytical Shift: Revenue Estimation through Demand and Profit Functions\nIn contrast, our analytical approach calculates expected revenue using demand and profit functions, offering a more nuanced measure of market size. For instance, at optimal prices, we estimate revenue to be $2500 per company. This method not only quantifies the revenue but also aligns it with strategic pricing and market dynamics.\n\nfR1_star &lt;- function(P1,P2) { fQ1_star(P1,P2) * P1}\nfR2_star &lt;- function(P1,P2) { fQ2_star(P1,P2) * P2}\n\nR1_star &lt;- fR1_star(P1_star, P2_star) # 2500\nR2_star &lt;- fR2_star(P1_star, P2_star) # 2500",

    "text": "12.2 Profit as Market Size: A Paradigm Shift\nMoving Beyond Revenue to Profit Maximization\nWhile traditional metrics emphasize revenue, our primary goal in entrepreneurial analytics is profit maximization. Investors often rely on revenue figures as rough proxies for profit. However, calculating optimal profit provides a more accurate and actionable measure of a company’s potential. For example, we determined an optimal profit of $1250 per company.\nProfit as a Long-term Success Predictor\nIt’s important to note that these profit estimates are based on a mature market understanding of the product, as if the product is well-established. Early-stage products typically see lower sales, growing as brand awareness and market penetration increase. Thus, profit, in this context, is a projection of the company’s potential as it matures, offering a more strategic perspective compared to traditional revenue-based market size metrics.\nNavigating the Growth Path\nThe transition from initial sales to achieving this profit potential involves significant investment in brand development, production capacity, and market expansion. Balancing pricing strategies with investment in growth is critical. The optimal growth rate should balance these elements, a topic that warrants further exploration to fully understand how competitive advantages impact this trajectory.",

    "text": "12.3 Decoding Competitive Advantages: A Bertrand Model Analysis\nIntroduction to Competitive Dynamics in Business\nIn this section, we delve into the intricate world of competitive advantages through the lens of the Bertrand oligopoly model. Our goal is to examine how variations in key parameters—market size, price sensitivity, customer loyalty, and unit variable cost—affect a business’s pricing, market share, and profitability. This analysis will provide entrepreneurs with practical insights into strategic decision-making.\n\nMarket Size (a1)\n\nPrices\nWhen Company 1’s target customer segment expands, indicating an increase in market size, how does it affect its pricing strategy compared to its competitor, Company 2? We use the Bertrand model to map these changes:\n\nfP1_a1 &lt;- function(a1){(-2*a1*b_2 + 2*b_1*b_2*c_1 + a_2*b_21 - b_2*b_21*c_2) / (4*b_1*b_2 - b_12*b_21)}\nfP2_a1 &lt;- function(a1){(-2*a_2*b_1 + 2*b_2*b_1*c_2 + a1*b_12 - b_1*b_12*c_1) / (4*b_2*b_1 - b_12*b_21)}\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,200) +\n  geom_function(fun = fP1_a1, color = \"blue2\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fP2_a1, color = \"blue4\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Market size of Company 1  ($a_1$)\"),\n       y = \"Prices of Companies 1 and 2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 130, y = 67, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (P[1]))), color = \"blue2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 180, y = 52, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (P[2]))), color = \"blue4\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium prices of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (a1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: As Company 1’s market size increases, its optimal pricing strategy changes, potentially allowing it to either increase market share or improve profit margins.\n\n\nQuantities\nNext, we explore how these market size changes impact the quantities sold by both companies:\n\nfQ1_a1 &lt;- function(a1) { a1 + b_1 * fP1_a1(a1) + b_12 * fP2_a1(a1)}\nfQ2_a1 &lt;- function(a1) { a_2 + b_2 * fP2_a1(a1) + b_21 * fP1_a1(a1)}\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,200) +\n  geom_function(fun = fQ1_a1, color = \"blue2\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fQ2_a1, color = \"blue4\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Market size of Company 1  ($a_1$)\"),\n       y = \"Quantities of Companies 1 and 2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 130, y = 84, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (Q[1]))), color = \"blue2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 180, y = 53, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (Q[2]))), color = \"blue4\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium quantities of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (a1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Takeaway: An increase in market size typically leads to higher sales volumes, but entrepreneurs must balance this with pricing strategies to ensure optimal profitability.\n\n\nMarket Share\nMarket share is crucial in understanding a company’s position in the market. Here’s how an increase in market size for Company 1 affects its market share relative to Company 2:\n\nfMS1_a1 &lt;- function(a1) {fQ1_a1(a1) / (fQ1_a1(a1) + fQ2_a1(a1)) }\nfMS2_a1 &lt;- function(a1) {fQ2_a1(a1) / (fQ1_a1(a1) + fQ2_a1(a1)) }\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,200) +\n  geom_function(fun = fMS1_a1, color = \"blue2\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fMS2_a1, color = \"blue4\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Market size of Company 1  ($a_1$)\"),\n       y = \"Market Shares of Companies 1 and 2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 140, y = 0.64, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (ms[1]))), color = \"blue2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 170, y = 0.33, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (ms[2]))), color = \"blue4\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium market shares of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (a1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nPractical Implication: Gaining a larger market share can be a significant competitive advantage, but it should be weighed against profitability goals.\n\n\nMargins\nMargins are a direct indicator of profitability. Let’s see how changes in market size influence the margins of both companies:\n\nfMargin1_a1 &lt;- function(a1) {fP1_a1(a1) - c_1 }\nfMargin2_a1 &lt;- function(a1) {fP2_a1(a1) - c_2 }\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,200) +\n  geom_function(fun = fMargin1_a1, color = \"forestgreen\", size = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fMargin2_a1, color = \"darkgreen\", size = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Market size of Company 1  ($a_1$ )\"),\n       y = \"Margins of Companies 1 and 2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 135, y = 44, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (margin[1]))), color = \"forestgreen\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 170, y = 25, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (margin[2]))), color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium margins of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (a1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Strategy Insight: Maintaining healthy margins while expanding market size is key to sustainable growth.\n\n\nProfits\nUltimately, profit is the goal. Here’s how market size affects the profits of Company 1 and Company 2:\n\nfProfit1_a1 &lt;- function(a1) { (fP1_a1(a1) - c_1) * fQ1_a1(a1) }\nfProfit2_a1 &lt;- function(a1) { (fP2_a1(a1) - c_2) * fQ1_a1(a1) }\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,200) +\n  geom_function(fun = fProfit1_a1, color = \"forestgreen\", size = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fProfit2_a1, color = \"darkgreen\", size = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Market size of Company 1  ($a_1$ )\"),\n       y = \"Profits for Companies 1 and 2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 140, y = 3500, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (profit[1]))), color = \"forestgreen\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 170, y = 2000, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (profit[2]))), color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium profits of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (\\(a_1\\)) changes.\n\n\n\n\nClearly, profits rise much more quickly for Company 1 than for Company 2 when Company 1 has a competitive advantage in market size.\nEntrepreneurial Insight: An increased market size can significantly boost profits, but strategic pricing and cost management are essential to capitalize on this advantage.\n\n\nReal-World Applications and Strategic Implications\nIn practice, an increase in market size could be due to various factors, such as shifts in customer preferences, regulatory changes, or market expansions. Entrepreneurs should use these insights to hypothesize potential market changes and test these hypotheses with data-driven analytics.\nThis analysis provides a framework for understanding how different competitive advantages impact a company’s profitability. It underscores the importance of strategic decision-making in leveraging these advantages, with a focus on optimizing profits while maintaining a competitive edge in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice Sensitivity (b1)\nUnderstanding Price Sensitivity with a Bertrand Oligopoly Model\nIn this subsection, we explore the concept of price sensitivity (b1) in the context of the Bertrand model and its implications for business strategy. Price sensitivity reflects how customers react to price changes—higher sensitivity means customers are more likely to change their buying behavior in response to price fluctuations. Let’s analyze how varying degrees of price sensitivity impact Company 1’s profitability and competitive position.\n\nPrices\nHow does a change in Company 1’s customers’ price sensitivity affect the pricing strategies of both Company 1 and its competitor, Company 2? We use the Bertrand model to demonstrate this:\n\nfP1_b1 &lt;- function(b1){(-2*a_1*b_2 + 2*b1*b_2*c_1 + a_2*b_21 - b_2*b_21*c_2) / (4*b1*b_2 - b_12*b_21)}\nfP2_b1 &lt;- function(b1){(-2*a_2*b1 + 2*b_2*b1*c_2 + a_1*b_12 - b1*b_12*c_1) / (4*b_2*b1 - b_21*b_12)}\n\nggplot() + xlim(-4, -0.50) + ylim(0,200) +\n  geom_function(fun = fP1_b1, color = \"blue2\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fP2_b1, color = \"blue4\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Price sensitivity of customers of Company 1  ($b_1$ )\"),\n       y = \"Prices\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -1.05, y = 160, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (P[1]))), color = \"blue2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -0.80, y = 41, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (P[2]))), color = \"blue4\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium prices of Company 1 and Company 2 when price sensitivity of Company 1 customers (b1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: A lower price sensitivity (b1) in Company 1’s customers leads to a more significant increase in its prices compared to Company 2. This non-linear, exponential increase in prices with small changes in price sensitivity illustrates a pricing advantage for Company 1.\n\n\nQuantities\nNow, let’s examine how price sensitivity affects the quantities sold by both companies:\n\nfQ1_b1 &lt;- function(b1) { a_1 + b1 * fP1_b1(b1) + b_12 * fP2_b1(b1)}\nfQ2_b1 &lt;- function(b1) { a_2 + b_2 * fP2_b1(b1) + b_21 * fP1_b1(b1)}\n\nggplot() + xlim(-4, -0.2) +\n  geom_function(fun = fQ1_b1, color = \"blue2\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fQ2_b1, color = \"blue4\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Price sensitivity of customers of Company 1  ($b_1$)\"),       \n       y = \"Quantities\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -0.80, y = 41, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (Q[1]))), color = \"blue2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -0.80, y = 200, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (Q[2]))), color = \"blue4\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium quantities of Company 1 and Company 2 when price sensitivity of Company 1 customers (b1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Implication: Interestingly, as Company 1’s price sensitivity decreases, its demand rises less than Company 2’s. This indicates that while Company 1 can increase prices without losing many customers, it also cedes some market share to Company 2 due to the substitution effect.\n\n\nProfits\nFinally, let’s see how varying levels of price sensitivity impact the profits of Company 1 and Company 2:\n\nfProfit1_b1 &lt;- function(b1) (fP1_b1(b1) - c_1) * fQ1_b1(b1)\nfProfit2_b1 &lt;- function(b1) (fP2_b1(b1) - c_2) * fQ2_b1(b1)\n\nggplot() + xlim(-4, -.3) + ylim(0,9000) +\n  geom_function(fun = fProfit1_b1, color = \"forestgreen\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fProfit2_b1, color = \"darkgreen\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Price sensitivity of customers of Company 1  ($b_1$)\"),\n       y = \"Profits\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -1.4, y = 7000, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (profit[1]))), color = \"forestgreen\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -0.6, y = 2200, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (profit[2]))), color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium profits of Company 1 and Company 2 when price sensitivity of Company 1 customers (b1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurial Insight: Reduced price sensitivity significantly enhances Company 1’s profits compared to Company 2. This suggests that businesses with less price-sensitive customers can leverage this advantage for substantial profit gains, even more so than gains from increased market share.\n\n\nReal-World Examples and Strategic Considerations\nExamples of reduced price sensitivity leading to higher profits are evident in companies like Apple and Tesla. These companies have successfully developed products and brand identities that resonate deeply with their customers, allowing them to maintain higher prices without losing customer loyalty.\n\nStrategic Questions for Entrepreneurs\n\nHow can your business decrease customer price sensitivity?\nCan you develop product features or branding that align closely with customer preferences?\nIs there an opportunity to create a community or status around your product that adds value beyond its physical attributes?\n\nThis analysis highlights the power of price sensitivity as a competitive advantage. Understanding and strategically leveraging this aspect can lead to significant profitability, even in markets where your company may not be the largest player. Entrepreneurs should focus not just on market share, but also on how to position their products in a way that reduces customer price sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Loyalty (b12 and b21)\nIn this section, we analyze how customer loyalty impacts a company’s strategic decisions and profitability within a Bertrand oligopoly framework. Customer loyalty is a nuanced competitive advantage that plays a crucial role in a company’s pricing strategy and market dynamics. Company 1 has a competitive advantage in customer loyalty when it gains more customers from Company 2 raising prices than it loses to Company 2 after a price increase. We examine these substitution effects (b12 and b21) that determine the degree of customer loyalty and their influence on Company 1’s pricing and profitability.\n\nPrices\nHow does an increase in Company 1’s customer loyalty affect its equilibrium prices compared to its competitor, Company 2? We explore this through our model:\n\n# b_12 increasing means that more customers come to F1 when F2 raises price P2\n# b_21 has a parallel decrease meaning that fewer customers go to F2 when F1 raises P1\n\nfP1_b12 &lt;- function(b12){(-2*a_1*b_2 + 2*b_1*b_2*c_1 + a_2*(2 - b12) - b_2*(2 - b12)*c_2) /  \n                                (4*b_1*b_2 - (b12)*(2 - b12))}\nfP2_b12 &lt;- function(b12){(-2*a_2*b_1 + 2*b_2*b_1*c_2 + a_1*(b12) - b_1*(b12)*c_1) / \n                                (4*b_2*b_1 - (2 - b12)*(b12))}\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,2) + ylim(0,75) +\n  geom_function(fun = fP1_b12, color = \"blue2\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fP2_b12, color = \"blue4\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Customer loyalty for Company 1 ($b_{12}$ and $b_{21}$)\"),\n       y = \"Prices\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.6, y = 36, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (P[1]))), color = \"blue2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.4, y = 59, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (P[2]))), color = \"blue4\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium prices of Company 1 and Company 2 when customer loyalty for Company 1 (b12 and b21) changes.\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: As Company 1’s customer loyalty increases, more customers leave Company 2 to buy from Company 1 when Company 2 raises its price (b12 effect). At the same time, increasing customer loyalty for Company 1 means that fewer customers of Company 1 move to Company 2 when Company 1 raises its price (b21 effect). Increasing customer loyalty causes Company 1 to steadily decrease its optimal price while Company 2 raises its price. Company 1 can reduce prices to attract customers from Company 2 without risk of a price war.\n\n\nProfits\nFinally, we assess how these loyalty-driven pricing strategies impact the profits of both companies:\n\nfQ1_b12 &lt;- function(b12) { a_1 + b_1 * fP1_b12(b12) + b12 * fP2_b12(b12)}\nfQ2_b12 &lt;- function(b12) { a_2 + b_2 * fP2_b12(b12) + b_21 * fP1_b12(b12)}\n\nfProfit1_b12 &lt;- function(b12) (fP1_b12(b12) - c_1) * fQ1_b12(b12)\nfProfit2_b12 &lt;- function(b12) (fP2_b12(b12) - c_2) * fQ2_b12(b12)\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,2) + ylim(0,2000) +\n  geom_function(fun = fProfit1_b12, color = \"green3\", size = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fProfit2_b12, color = \"green4\", size = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Customer loyalty for Company 1  ($b_{12}$ and $b_{21}$)\"),\n       y = \"Profits\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.7, y = 1700, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (profit[1]))), color = \"green3\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.4, y = 900, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (profit[2]))), color = \"green4\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium profits of Company 1 and Company 2 when customer loyalty for Company 1 (b12 and b12) changes.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Implication: The analysis reveals that Company 1’s strategy to lower prices, driven by increased customer loyalty, is profitable. Despite reduced prices, Company 1 gains enough customers from Company 2 to increase its overall profits. This underscores the value of cultivating customer loyalty as a competitive advantage.\n\n\nReal-World Applications and Strategic Considerations\n\nHow can you build customer loyalty?\nAre there branding or service strategies that can increase customer retention even if prices are adjusted?\nConsider the long-term benefits of customer loyalty over short-term profit maximization. Customer loyalty is not just about retaining customers but also about leveraging this loyalty for strategic pricing and market share gains. The key for entrepreneurs is to understand how increased loyalty can be used to strategically adjust prices and capture a larger market share, ultimately leading to higher profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit Variable Cost (c1)\nHow does a competitive advantage in unit variable cost (c1) impact a company’s pricing strategy and profitability in a Bertrand oligopoly. We explore how changes in Company 1’s unit costs influence its market positioning and financial outcomes, providing key insights into cost management strategies.\n\nPrices\nWhat happens to the equilibrium prices of companies 1 and 2 when Company 1 gains a variable cost advantage? Let’s visualize this through our model:\n\nfP1_c1 &lt;- function(c1) {(-2*a_1*b_2 + 2*b_1*b_2*c1 + a_2*b_21 - b_2*b_21*c_2) / (4*b_1*b_2 - b_12*b_21)}\nfP2_c1 &lt;- function(c1) {(-2*a_2*b_1 + 2*b_2*b_1*c_2 + a_1*b_12 - b_1*b_12*c1) / (4*b_2*b_1 - b_21*b_12)}\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,50) + ylim(0,65) +\n  geom_function(fun = fP1_c1, color = \"blue2\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fP2_c1, color = \"blue4\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Unit cost of Company 1  ($c_1$ )\"),\n       y = \"Prices\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 30, y = 58, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (P[1]))), color = \"blue2\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 40, y = 47, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (P[2]))), color = \"blue4\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium prices of Company 1 and Company 2 when variable cost of Company 1 (c1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: A decrease in Company 1’s unit variable cost allows it to reduce prices more effectively than Company 2. This strategic lowering of prices not only attracts more customers from Company 2 but also improves Company 1’s profit margins due to the reduced costs.\n\n\nProfits\nNow, let’s assess how these cost-driven pricing strategies impact the profits of both companies:\n\nfQ1_c1 &lt;- function(c1) { a_1 + b_1 * fP1_c1(c1) + b_12 * fP2_c1(c1)}\nfQ2_c1 &lt;- function(c1) { a_2 + b_2 * fP2_c1(c1) + b_21 * fP1_c1(c1)}\n\nfProfit1_c1 &lt;- function(c1) (fP1_c1(c1) - c1) * fQ1_c1(c1)\nfProfit2_c1 &lt;- function(c1) (fP2_c1(c1) - c_2) * fQ2_c1(c1)\n\nggplot() + xlim(0,50) + ylim(0,2800) +\n  geom_function(fun = fProfit1_c1, color = \"forestgreen\", linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_function(fun = fProfit2_c1, color = \"darkgreen\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"Cost of Company 1  ($c_1$)\"),\n       y = \"Profits\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 18, y = 2100, label = expression(paste(\" Company 1 \" (profit[1]))), color = \"forestgreen\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 10, y = 850, label = expression(paste(\" Company 2 \" (profit[2]))), color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  theme_hc()\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium profits of Company 1 and Company 2 when cost of Company 1 (c1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Implication: Company 1’s profit increases significantly as its unit cost decreases. This rise in profit is attributed to both the increased margin resulting from lower costs and the gain in market share driven by reduced prices. It highlights the dual benefit of cost management — enhancing profitability while increasing competitive market presence.\n\n\nReal-World Applications and Strategic Considerations\n\nHow can your company achieve similar cost advantages? Consider options like optimizing supply chains, investing in efficient technologies, or negotiating better terms with suppliers.\nReflect on the balance between reducing prices to gain market share and maintaining prices to maximize profit margins.\nUnderstand that cost management is not just an operational issue but a strategic tool that can significantly impact market dynamics and profitability.\n\nUnit variable cost is a strategic lever in competitive markets. By effectively managing and reducing costs, a company can not only improve its profitability but also enhance its competitive position through strategic pricing. For entrepreneurs, this insight provides a clear directive: vigilantly manage costs and strategically utilize cost advantages to gain a market edge.",

    "text": "13.1 Why Competitive Dynamics Matter to Entrepreneurs\nIn the previous chapter, we navigated the delicate dance of pricing in a competitive landscape—how to strategically set prices to maximize profits when those profits hinge on both your and your competitor’s pricing decisions. This chapter takes us beyond the confines of pricing, venturing into the strategic battlegrounds where competitive advantages are forged. These are the arenas that shape the profit potential of your pricing strategies. Through the lens of game theory, we offer entrepreneurs a powerful toolkit to understand and master the competitive dynamics that dictate market positioning, drive innovation, and ultimately, fuel profitability. Game theory sheds light on the intricate strategic interplay between firms, revealing how decisions related to product development, pricing, and market entry are far from isolated—they’re profoundly interconnected.\nAt its core, entrepreneurship is about pioneering innovation that aligns products with customer desires in uniquely compelling ways, and investing in capabilities to deliver to customers. These challenges are conquered not through price tags alone but through a deep understanding of the competitive landscape. This chapter is your guide through the complexities of these strategic interactions, spotlighting the game theoretic insights essential for securing competitive advantages. The essence of competitive dynamics is to engage in the strategic behavior that redefines the profit potential of pricing in competition. It is about competing on things other than price.\nEntrepreneurs don’t just participate in markets; they redefine them. They achieve this through differentiation—crafting products or services that don’t merely compete on price but stand out through their unparalleled value propositions. This drive for distinction is at the heart of competitive dynamics in entrepreneurship. It’s about making strategic decisions that not only reshape out your product’s demand but also define your operational blueprint for efficiency. These decisions interlock, each one a strategic move in a grand game of entrepreneurial chess.\nGame theory provides the strategic vantage point to view these decisions not as isolated choices but as integral parts of an ecosystem where your actions echo against those of your competitors. Game theory equips you with the foresight to understand these interdependencies, guiding you toward more strategic, informed decisions. This insight is invaluable; it lays the foundation for your competitive advantage long before pricing strategies come into play.\nThus, competitive dynamics are not just they sandbox you play in but the strategic moves that change the sandbox in your favor. They encapsulate the essence of strategic entrepreneurship: navigating a landscape where every decision you make is a strategic move, intertwined with the outcomes of others. This chapter delves into these dynamics, showcasing how game theory empowers entrepreneurs to not only compete but to excel in markets where innovation and differentiation are the keys to success.",

    "text": "13.2 Game Theory in Entrepreneurship\nGame theory is more than a theoretical construct or a toolkit for gamers to dominate at Monopoly; it’s a critical framework for entrepreneurs navigating the competitive business landscape. It demystifies the complex process of strategic decision-making in an environment where outcomes are influenced not just by your actions, but also by the responses of competitors, partners, and customers.\n\nStrategic Interplay\nConsider the marketplace as a strategic battleground where every move you make—a product launch, pricing strategy, marketing initiative, or operational improvement—is scrutinized and potentially countered by competitors. This interplay doesn’t occur in a vacuum; it ignites a sequence of strategic responses, weaving a web of interdependencies.\nGame theory offers a lens to understand and navigate this intricate network, highlighting how strategic choices are intertwined. It underscores the critical insight that the success of your decisions hinges on the interconnected strategies within your business ecosystem. This understanding is pivotal for several reasons:\n\nEnhanced Competitive Insight: By acknowledging the interconnected nature of market actions, entrepreneurs can better predict competitor reactions, enabling strategic moves that are informed, proactive, and one step ahead.\nInformed Strategic Choices: Grasping the concept of interdependence aids in identifying actions that not only advance your position but also shape the competitive landscape in your favor, thus fostering optimal strategic decision-making.\nOpportunities for Collaboration: Beyond competitive dynamics, game theory also reveals avenues for negotiation and cooperation, identifying potential alliances that bolster your competitive stance.\n\nThrough game theory, entrepreneurs gain the ability to not just react to the competitive environment but to actively influence its evolution, equipping them with the strategies to thrive in tomorrow’s market.\n\n\nBuilding and Solving Strategic Games\nWe will follow the same structured approach to construct and solve all strategic games:\n\nIdentify the Players: Pinpoint the competitors, customers, or partners influencing your market dynamics.\nIdentify Possible Actions: Catalog the strategic options available to these players.\nDetermine Payoffs: Assess the potential performance outcomes of these strategic choices.\nFormulate Strategies: Map the best reactions players can make in response to the moves of their competitors.\nSolve for Equilibrium: Identify the outcome that is most likely to happen where all players are making their optimal moves.\n\nMastering these steps isn’t just academic; it’s pragmatically necessary. This chapter applies these stages to various strategic scenarios. Our aim is not to exhaustively review known games and their lessons but to empower you to craft bespoke strategic games that reflect your unique competitive context.\nIn practice, the utility of game theory unfolds in its application to real-world challenges. While familiarity with pre-existing games provides a useful analogy for strategy development, the true power lies in customizing game theory principles to navigate your specific competitive landscapes. Thus, we focus on empowering you with the tools to create and solve games that resonate with your strategic needs, paving the way for informed decisions and sustainable competitive advantages.",

    "section": "13.3 Simultaneous Games",
    "text": "13.3 Simultaneous Games\nWe begin our study of game theory by considering simultaneous games:\n\nPlayers are tasked with predicting their competitors’ strategies without the benefit of observing their actions first. Simultaneity here means that all players make their decisions concurrently.\nThey choose strategies that encompass the comprehensive set of responses to every potential move a competitor might make. Thus, the focus shifts from reacting to actual actions to preparing for all conceivable ones.\nThey arrive at an equilibrium (expected outcome) where no players want to deviate because every player’s decision has been accurately forecasted and counteracted with the best response.\n\nWe will construct and analyze simultaneous games using the normal form representation, which organizes a game into a matrix format. This approach serves as an excellent foundation for understanding the core principles involved in creating and solving games. It’s essential for effectively applying game theory to real-world business challenges, offering a structured method to visualize and assess the strategic options and outcomes available to all players involved.\n\nPricing Game with a Single Nash Equilibrium\nLet’s begin with a variation on the Prisoner’s Dilemma, tailored to an entrepreneurial context. Two startups, selling basically the same product through an online retail platform, are considering whether to cut prices to gain market share. The startups face the challenge of making their decisions in tandem, without the luxury of knowing the other’s choice ahead of time. The consequences of their decisions are heavily dependent on the combination of actions they each take, showcasing the strategic complexity and uncertainty inherent in competitive markets.\nWe build and solve the game working systematically through the five stages:\n\nStep 1: Identify the Players\nPlayers: The two competing startups contemplating price reductions are the players in this particular game:\n\nStartup A (You), and\nStartup B (Your Competitor).\n\n\n\nStep 2: Outline Possible Actions\nActions: Each startup has two options:\n\nto cut prices (Cut) or\nto maintain current prices (Hold).\n\n\n\nStep 3: Determine Payoffs\nPayoffs represent the outcomes of different combinations of actions, defined here as ordinal values. These values rank the preferences of the players without specifying exact monetary benefits, where a payoff of 2 is more desirable than a payoff of 1, but is not necessarily twice as good.\n\nWhen both choose to hold: Margins remain stable, leading to moderate gains for each, scored as a 1.\nWhen one cuts while the other holds: The startup that cuts price captures additional market share, earning a payoff of 2, while the other, maintaining its prices, faces a disadvantage, incurring a payoff of -2.\nWhen both decide to cut: a price war ensues, diminishing profits for both parties, reflected by payoffs of -1 each.\n\nArmed with an understanding of the players, their possible actions, and the associated payoffs, we’re equipped to layout the game in a normal form matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Players, actions, and payoffs of the startup pricing (prisoner’s dilemma) game.\n\n\n\nIn this representation:\n\nThe “row player” (Startup A), shown in blue, faces the decision to hold or cut prices.\nSimilarly, the “column player” (Startup B), illustrated in green, navigates the same choices.\nThe matrix delineates the ordinal payoffs for Startup A (row player) in the bottom left of each cell and for Startup B (column player) in the upper right, corresponding to every possible action pairing.\n\nThis visual and structured approach to defining the game scenario illuminates the strategic interplay at hand, setting the stage for further analysis to discern optimal strategies and anticipate potential equilibrium outcomes.\n\n\nStep 4: Identify Player Strategies\nIn game theory, a player’s strategy encompasses the suite of actions they would select as their best response to every potential move their competitor might make. An action qualifies as a best response when it secures the highest payoff among the available options.\nFor Startup A, strategic decisions hinge on Startup B’s pricing actions:\n\nIf Startup B opts to hold its prices, Startup A can maximize its benefit by cutting its own prices. This aggressive pricing strategy yields a higher payoff of 2, as opposed to the moderate gain of 1 that comes with maintaining price levels.\nIf Startup B cuts its prices, Startup A finds its most favorable outcome (-1) in reciprocating the price cut, aligning with Startup B’s aggressive strategy.\n\nStartup A’s strategic pattern can be visually represented using directional arrows pointing towards actions yielding the highest payoffs, based on Startup B’s decisions.1 As illustrated in Figure 13.2, both arrows for Startup A direct towards a price cut, indicating a strategy for Startup A to always opt for a price reduction, irrespective of Startup B’s choice.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Startup A’s strategy in the (prisoner’s dilemma) pricing game – cut if Startup B chooses hold and cut if Startup B chooses cut.\n\n\n\nStartup B’s strategy mirrors this approach:\n\nFacing a price hold from Startup A, Startup B’s advantageous move is to cut prices.\nSimilarly, when Startup A cuts prices, Startup B’s best strategy remains to cut, maintaining competitive parity.\n\nThis analysis reveals a pivotal insight: both startups are inclined towards a dominant strategy of price reduction under all circumstances, setting the stage for a potential price war. This is a normal form representation of undifferentiated Bertrand competition that eventually descends into price wars and zero profits. Such a scenario underscores the strategic intricacies inherent in competitive markets, where anticipating and countering the moves of rivals can define the contours of business success.\n\n\nStep 5: Solve for Equilibrium\nThe Nash equilibrium3 is the strategic point where all players in a game settle on choices that leave them with no incentive to pursue a different course of action, provided that every other player remains constant in their strategy. This state of mutual best responses occurs when each player’s strategy is the best they can opt for, considering the strategies chosen by their competitors.\nThe game’s matrix, illustrated in Figure 13.3, highlights strategies through arrows pointing towards actions that garner the highest payoffs. The Nash Equilibrium is achieved when both startups opt to reduce prices, a strategy represented by arrows converging on the cut/cut decision. This scenario not only instigates a price war, diminishing profits for both entities but also exemplifies a dominant strategies equilibrium, where each firm’s unilateral decision to cut prices reflects the optimal response to the anticipated action of the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: The Nash Equilibrium in this entrepreneurial pricing game arises at cut/cut, signifying simultaneous best responses leading to potentially suboptimal collective outcomes.\n\n\n\nThis real-world rendition of the Prisoner’s Dilemma epitomizes a broader class of strategic games where players, driven by dominant strategies, inadvertently converge on outcomes that might not serve their collective best interests. Through this lens, the dilemma doesn’t just offer a theoretical exercise but rather a practical reflection on the dynamics of competitive strategy, underscoring the critical importance of strategic foresight and the potential consequences of uncoordinated competitive aggression.\n\n\nPractical Application: Navigating Competitive Strategy\nThe Prisoner’s Dilemma isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a vivid illustration of the strategic decisions entrepreneurs face daily. It highlights the importance of considering both the immediate impact of your actions and how competitors might respond.\nAggressive strategies, like price cuts, may offer quick wins but understanding the broader dynamics of competition can guide you towards strategies that ensure long-term market stability and profitability.\nMastering game theory’s principles, as demonstrated through the Prisoner’s Dilemma and its Nash equilibrium, empowers entrepreneurs to:\n\nForecast Competitor Behavior: Identifying dominant strategies helps predict competitor moves, giving you a strategic edge.\nLook Beyond the Short Term: It encourages strategies that safeguard against potential market disruptions, favoring sustainable success.\nFind Collaboration Opportunities: Understanding mutual dependencies can reveal partnerships that amplify your competitive advantage.\nClarify Decision-Making: Game theory models offer a clear visual framework to assess strategies and their outcomes, making complex decisions more manageable.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Multiple Equilibria\nThe dynamics of strategic partnerships often mirror those found in coordination games, characterized by the presence of multiple equilibria. These scenarios challenge firms to make decisions that not only serve their own interests but are also critical for the collective success of the alliance.\nImagine two startups, each with its own specialized technology, considering a strategic alliance. The effectiveness of their partnership is contingent on selecting operational standards or development trajectories that are mutually compatible. This decision-making process is akin to navigating a coordination game, where the most favorable outcomes are achieved through synchronized choices.\n\nIdentifying the Players and Actions\nThe players in this scenario are:\n\nStartup A, with a specialization in software development,\nStartup B, specializing in hardware production.\n\nTheir actions involve choosing between two operational standards or development paths: Standard X or Standard Y.\n\n\nDetermining Payoffs\nThe payoffs reflect the compatibility of operational standards and the synergy effect on the partnership:\n\nBoth choose Standard X: High compatibility and synergy, leading to significant mutual benefits.\nBoth choose Standard Y: Similar to X, but with nuances that slightly favor Startup B’s hardware orientation.\nDisparate choices lead to compatibility issues, diminishing the potential benefits of the partnership.\n\n\n\nConstructing the Game in Normal Form\nThe game matrix, visualized in Figure 13.4, elucidates the outcomes based on the combinations of choices by the startups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: Construction of the partnership coordination game.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy and Equilibria\nIn this partnership game, both startups aim to align on a standard, understanding that compatibility maximizes the partnership’s value. The game is solved in Figure 13.5 where the presence of multiple Nash equilibria reflects the possible outcomes where each startup’s choice complements the other’s, ensuring mutual benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: Strategies and equilibrium outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication to Strategic Partnerships\nThe presence of multiple equilibria in such a strategic decision-making context underscores the need for mechanisms that can guide the startups toward a single, mutually beneficial equilibrium. This could involve pre-negotiation agreements, shared vision sessions, or adopting a sequential decision-making approach where one startup’s choice informs the other’s decision, akin to moves in a sequential game.\nSuch strategies not only help align the startups’ decisions but also build a foundation for trust and cooperation, essential elements for the success of any strategic partnership. By effectively navigating these coordination challenges, startups can leverage their alliance as a competitive advantage, driving innovation and capturing greater market share.\nStrategic partnerships, through the lens of game theory, reveal the complexities and opportunities inherent in collaboration. By understanding and applying the principles of coordination games, firms can more effectively navigate the intricacies of partnership dynamics, steering towards decisions that enhance both their individual prospects and collective success.\n\n\n\nNavigating Uncertainty with Mixed Strategies: Rock-Paper-Scissors\nRock-paper-scissors, beyond being a childhood game, exemplifies strategic decisions in scenarios lacking a clear Nash Equilibrium. This game illustrates that sometimes, business strategies don’t lead to straightforward outcomes and that embracing flexibility and unpredictability can be advantageous.\n\nConstructing the Game\nIn constructing payoffs for rock-paper-scissors, we use ordinal payoffs to signify preferences rather than exact values. For instance, tying might have a payoff of 0, a win 1, and a loss -1, setting a baseline for evaluating outcomes. The formal game is represented in Figure 13.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: Construction of the rock-paper-scissors game.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving the Game\nThe solution to the rock-paper-scissors game is given in Figure 13.7 with curious results. The strategies of both players are not hard to find but there is no Nash equilibrium. Analysis reveals no single strategy guarantees a win, because there is every cell has an arrow leaving meaning that there is no outcome that is simultaneously a best response for both players. When you build and solve bespoke games for your context, you may not find a pure strategies equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: Strategies with no Nash equilibrium outcome that can be shown in normal form.\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed-strategies Equilibrium\nWhen the game has no Nash equilibrium, you may turn to the concept of mixed-strategies, randomizing decisions for direction in decision-making. The problem for players of rock-paper-scissors is that any action can be countered with an action that will always win. It doesn’t take long for players (often children) to learn that they must randomize their choice or they will always lose. If they place \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) probability on each choice to avoid predictability, they will lose one-third of the games, win one-third, and tie one-third.\nThis approach is a mixed-strategy and leads to a mixed-strategies equilibrium. It does not tell you what action to take but it does help you choose randomization. The equilibrium does not allow us to predict the outcome that will happen but it does predict the the probability of any outcome. This is an equilibrium because no player has an incentive to deviate.\nThis approach underscores the importance of adaptability and the potential to incorporate randomness into strategic planning, especially in highly competitive or uncertain markets.\n\n\n\nBuild Custom Games\nDiving into the practical application of game theory, we aim to equip you with the ability to craft and solve games tailored to the unique strategic challenges of your business environment. This approach ensures that insights are directly applicable, guiding you toward informed strategic decisions in real scenarios.”\nA pivotal step in applying game theory is defining payoffs—the outcomes of strategic decisions. We’ll explore both ordinal and cardinal payoffs: ordinal payoffs simplify strategic preferences without specific values, offering a clear view of options, while cardinal payoffs provide a detailed, quantitative analysis of decisions’ impacts. By mastering these methods, you’ll be equipped to use game theory effectively, leveraging strategic insights for competitive advantage.\n\nOrdinal Payoffs: A Logical Approach\nIdentifying payoffs is a crucial yet challenging step in game theory, particularly when the strategic scenario defines players and actions clearly, but payoffs remain ambiguous. For ordinal payoffs, the key is to ensure they represent a clear ranking of outcomes without necessitating specific values or units. Start by selecting a baseline scenario and assigning payoffs that mirror the expected order of preferences. For instance, in a rock-paper-scissors game, a tie scenario like Rock/Rock might be assigned a payoff of 0/0. This sets a foundation to then value a win at one point and a loss at negative one, simplifying the construction of the game matrix based on these relative rankings.\nOrdinal payoffs expedite game building by sidestepping detailed financial calculations, provided they accurately reflect the preference order. By methodically considering the relative merits of different strategic outcomes, you not only craft a clearer game structure but also enhance your strategic insights, enabling informed decision-making and predictable outcomes.\n\n\nCardinal Payoffs: A Competition Analytics Approach\n\nWhile ordinal payoffs rank outcomes based on preferences, cardinal payoffs require quantifiable insights often not evident through mere speculation. These payoffs, crucial for understanding the tangible outcomes of strategic choices, are derived from profit analytics. Whether it’s profits from a one-time differentiated Bertrand competition or the net present value (NPV) of ongoing competitive profits, cardinal payoffs quantify the financial impact of decisions over the duration of interdependence between players. This depth of analysis, rooted in profit calculations, provides a comprehensive view of potential strategic outcomes.\n\nA Demonstration Case of Airbus and Boeing Choosing to Develop a New Aircraft\n\n\nAirbus vs. Boeing: A Demonstration of Cardinal Payoffs\nConsider Airbus and Boeing, evaluating whether to develop a new, technologically advanced aircraft. This strategic decision is influenced by potential market responses, competitive actions, and financial implications. Here’s how we break down their game using cardinal payoffs derived from profit analytics.\nPlayers: Airbus and Boeing\nActions: Each can either Innovate or Not Innovate.\nPayoffs: Derived from a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, reflecting the net present value (NPV) of the calculated Bertrand oligopoly profits over 20 years. These are hypothetical yet realistic figures based on competitive analytics and demand forecasts:\n\nBoth not innovate: Airbus NPV = $30B; Boeing NPV = $40B.\nAirbus innovate, Boeing not innovate: Airbus NPV = $40B; Boeing NPV = $20B.\nBoeing innovate, Airbus not innovate: Airbus NPV = $20B; Boeing NPV = $30B.\nBoth innovate: Airbus NPV = -$10B; Boeing NPV = -$20B.\n\nThe determination of these payoffs involves extensive data collection and demand analysis. For instance, we estimate demand curves for each scenario, accounting for variable and fixed costs—including R&D investments. This process, while data-intensive, is crucial for major strategic decisions that could define the company’s future.\nStrategies and Equilibrium:\nThe game matrix, illustrated in Figure 13.8, reveals that Boeing has a dominant strategy not to innovate, allowing Airbus to launch the new aircraft and secure an enhanced competitive position in the advanced technology market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Construction and solution of a game in normal form where Airbus and Boeing decide whether to launch a new aircraft: Boeing has a dominant strategy not to launch so Airbus launches and profits from a newly achieved competitive advantage.\n\n\n\nThis example underscores the significance of grounding strategic decisions in solid analytics. While ordinal payoffs offer quick strategic insights, cardinal payoffs provide the depth necessary for high-stakes decision-making, ensuring strategies are not just intuitive but analytically sound.",

    "text": "13.4 Sequential Games\nUnlike the simultaneous games we’ve explored, many real-world strategic decisions unfold in a sequence rather than all at once. In sequential games, players make their moves one after another, allowing later players to react to the decisions of those who acted before them. This sequence of moving and responding fundamentally changes the game’s dynamics and treating them like a simultaneous game leads to flawed strategies and disappointing outcomes.\nIn sequential games, the timing and order of decisions are not insignificant details. The ability to observe and react to a competitor’s move can be a significant strategic advantage. The ability to anticipate a competitor’s response allows players to move pre-emptively and shape the competitive environment in their favor. Moving first, for example, allows a firm to make strategic commitments that can deter competitors, secure resources, or lock in advantageous positions by forcing competitors to respond to the early mover on less favorable terms.\nIn sequential games, the dynamics go beyond mere observation and response. They open up the possibility of non-credible threats, where a player might threaten to take actions that, upon closer inspection, wouldn’t actually be in their interest to carry out. Such threats, lacking in credibility, should typically be ignored, as they’re unlikely to be acted upon. Distinguishing between credible and non-credible strategies becomes a critical skill in navigating the strategic landscape of sequential games.\nThankfully, the challenge of identifying and countering non-credible threats can be systematically addressed by constructing the game in an extensive form (essentially, a decision tree) and solving it through backward induction. This method for identifying strategies, simplifies the analysis by breaking down the game into a sequence of decisions to choose the best response, starting from the end and working backwards. By doing so, it becomes evident which threats or actions are actually in a player’s interest to follow through on, based on the outcomes of subsequent moves.\nThis method not only clarifies which strategies are credible but also enhances strategic planning and decision-making. It allows entrepreneurs and strategists to anticipate competitor moves more accurately, devise responses that effectively counter non-credible threats, and leverage their own strategic moves for maximum impact. Through the use of extensive form games and backward induction, the complex interdependencies of sequential decisions become navigable, empowering businesses to craft strategies that are both informed and actionable.\n\nConsider a simple game where an entrepreneur deliberates entering a market dominated by a monopolist. The entrepreneur’s choices are to enter or not enter, while the monopolist can fight the entry with aggressive pricing or accommodate by sharing the market. The outcomes are quantified as follows:\n\nEnter and fight: The entrepreneur faces a $5M loss, while the monopolist gains $4M.\nEnter and accommodate: Both parties profit by $5M each.\nNot enter: Regardless of the monopolist’s choice, the entrepreneur gains nothing, and the monopolist secures a $12M profit.\n\nSolving this game in normal form reveals two Nash equilibria seen in Figure 13.9: one where the monopolist fights and deters entry, and another where the entrant enters and is accommodated. But which outcome is more likely?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: If the entry game is played simultaneously in normal form, the solution is two Nash equilibria where the monopolist may fight or accommodate and the entrant may enter or not enter.\n\n\n\nGiven the logical sequence of moves, the entrant must decide first, providing the monopolist with something to fight or accommodate. This sequential decision-making highlights the non-credibility of the monopolist’s threat to fight. If the entrant chooses to enter, knowing the monopolist’s best interest lies in accommodating, the threat of a price war becomes ineffective. This realization negates the not enter/fight equilibrium, leaving enter/accommodate as the most plausible outcome.\nThe crux of sequential games is recognizing that threats lacking in credibility—those not in a player’s best interest to execute—should not influence decision-making. The sequencing of moves clarifies which strategies are bluffs and which are genuine, guiding players towards rational and beneficial outcomes. This principle is pivotal in strategic environments where timing and order of actions shape the competitive landscape, enabling players to navigate complex scenarios with foresight and precision.\n\nConstructing Sequential Games in Extensive Form\nWhen dealing with sequential-move games, particularly those with multiple stages, constructing them in extensive form enhances clarity. This format visualizes the game as a decision tree, where nodes represent decision points for players, and branches indicate possible actions.\nFor illustration, let’s revisit the monopolist-entrant game, now depicted in extensive form as seen in Figure 13.10. In this decision tree:\n\n“E” marks the entrant’s decision node: to enter or not enter.\n“M” nodes represent the monopolist’s subsequent choices: to fight by initiating a price war or to accommodate by maintaining high prices and sharing the market.\n\nThe payoffs, aligned with our previous discussion in normal form, are noted at each terminal node, reflecting the outcomes of combined actions. The arrangement of payoffs (whether on the left or right) should maintain consistency and clear labeling to avoid confusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.10: Construction of the entry game with sequential moves in extensive form: “E” is the entrant, “M” is the monopolist, their possible actions are marked on the paths, and their payoffs are given at the end of each decision path.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving Sequential Games Through Backward Induction\nTo solve sequential games in extensive form, we use a method known as backward induction, which clarifies the decision-making process by working from the game’s end back to its start. This method helps us pinpoint the best response at each decision point, considering the subsequent moves of other players.\nReturning to our monopolist-entrant game in extensive form, we start with the monopolist’s final decisions. Given the choice between a price war and maintaining high prices after the entrant has entered, the monopolist prefers the latter, yielding a higher payoff. This preference is represented in Figure 13.11 by a bolded arrow towards the high price decision, indicating the monopolist’s best response. When the entrant does not enter, we move to the lower node for the monopolist where it retains monopoly status regardless of whether if fights or accommodates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.11: Solving the entry game in extensive form through backward induction: best responses are indicated by bolded arrows, leading to the sub-game perfect equilibrium.\n\n\n\nThe entrant, considering the monopolist’s response, finds entering the market to be the best move, given it leads to a mutually beneficial profit sharing. This decision path is marked, leading to the game’s equilibrium point, where both firms play their best responses simultaneously.\nThe key outcome of backward induction is the sub-game perfect equilibrium, which inherently discounts non-credible threats. Unlike in our initial normal form game, where the monopolist’s threat of a price war might deter entry, sequential analysis reveals such threats as non-credible. The monopolist, in reality, would choose to accommodate entry, rendering the price war strategy implausible when actions unfold over time.\nThus, the sub-game perfect equilibrium identified through backward induction is a refined Nash equilibrium specific to sequential games.4 It focuses on credible strategies by considering the actual sequence of moves, ensuring that only feasible outcomes—those based on rational, best-response strategies—are considered viable. In doing so, it sidesteps the ambiguity of non-credible threats found in simultaneous-move games, offering a clear pathway to strategic decision-making in real-world scenarios.",

    "section": "13.5 Strategic Commitment",
    "text": "13.5 Strategic Commitment\nChances are that you were confused with the sub-game perfect equilibrium outcome of the sequential game between the monopolist and the entrant. Monopolists do not have the reputation of welcoming new entrants with open arms, otherwise there would have been no need for antitrust laws and prosecution. Why isn’t the monopolist in our entry game stronger?\nThe reason is simply because we haven’t yet given it the opportunity to move before the entrant. More specifically, the monopolist failed to deter entry because its threat of starting a price war was not credible. The price war was not credible because the payoff of a price war was less than the payoff of sharing the market with the entrant at a high price. The monopolist seems weak in this game because it is unable to commit to a price war.\nStrategic commitment is a powerful concept in business strategy that enables a firm to shape the competitive landscape to its advantage. At its core, strategic commitment involves making a decisive move that changes the game’s dynamics, influencing competitors’ actions and improving the firm’s position. This move could be an investment, a product launch, or any action that commits the firm to a specific strategy.\nThe essence of strategic commitment lies in the concept of “burning bridges,” where a firm deliberately limits its future options to signal its determination and change the course of competition. This could mean, for example, that a monopolist cutting costs by moving down the learning curve can reduce the costs of a price war, allowing a credible commitment that may deterring potential entrants from competing.\nFor a strategic commitment to be effective, it must be:\n\nVisible: Competitors must be aware of the action to be influenced by it.\nUnderstandable: The strategic intent behind the action must be clear to competitors.\nCredible: Competitors must believe that the firm will follow through on its commitment.\nIrreversible: The action cannot be easily undone, ensuring the commitment’s credibility.\n\nIrreversibility is critical; it cements the firm’s commitment and forces competitors to respond accordingly. This is where the distinction between sunk costs and recoverable fixed costs becomes important. Sunk costs, once incurred, cannot be recovered and thus embody the firm’s commitment to its chosen strategy.5 When a position can be easily and rationally reversed, the competitor will expect it to be reversed so it is not credible. When we seek to change the nature of the game through strategic commitment, threats must be credible; there can be no possibility of reversing our position.\nStrategic commitment can reshape competitive dynamics by making certain competitor actions (such as entering a market or starting a price war) less attractive or even untenable. It’s about creating a competitive edge by shaping the strategic choices available to your rivals in a way that favors your firm.\nIn practical terms, strategic commitment might involve investing in specialized assets that serve a particular market segment, thereby signaling a long-term commitment to that segment. Or it might involve adopting technologies that set new industry standards, making it harder for competitors to offer alternative solutions. Each of these actions, by its nature, changes the competitive landscape and can help secure a more advantageous position for the firm.\nIn the game where a monopolist faces the possibility of new entrants, strategic commitment can play a crucial role in deterring entry and maintaining a competitive advantage. One effective, and legal, way for a monopolist to commit to fierce competition with an entrant is to invest in moving down the learning curve to reduce variable costs below the costs of a potential entrant who has no history to learn from. This approach involves improving operational efficiency to reduce variable costs, allowing the monopolist to set prices low enough to deter entry while still maintaining profitable margins.\nBy investing in technologies, processes, or practices that enhance efficiency, a monopolist can ensure its costs are continually decreasing. This strategic commitment to operational excellence becomes visible and credible to potential entrants. They recognize the monopolist’s cost advantage and the consequent ability to compete aggressively on price, making entry less attractive.\nThe opportunity for the monopolist to invest in enhanced efficiency and lower costs adds to the entry game. We add an earlier stage where the monopolist must decide whether to “invest” in strategic commitment by investing in efficiency and learning. If it does not invest, the game is unchanged; if it does, the monopolist’s payoffs change. After investment, the payoff of a price war increases from $4M to $8M. This new game, with its attempted strategic commitment, is constructed and solved in Figure 13.12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.12: Construction and solution of the entry game with strategic commitment: Monopolist is able to deter entry in a sequential game.\n\n\n\nAnother powerful form of strategic commitment is investing in branding. A strong brand creates a differentiated customer experience that new entrants cannot easily replicate. Brand loyalty acts as a barrier to entry by requiring new entrants to not only match but significantly exceed the monopolist’s value proposition to gain customer attention. This necessitates substantial investments in marketing and product development from the entrant, raising the cost and risk of entry.\nBoth moving down the learning curve and building a strong brand are strategic commitments that change the competitive game. They alter the payoffs for potential entrants, making it clear that entering the market would not yield the expected returns. These strategies are both visible and irreversible—investments in efficiency and brand equity cannot be quickly undone, and their effects persist over time, reinforcing the monopolist’s competitive position.\nIn summary, strategic commitment through operational efficiency and branding provides a clear, ethical, and legally sound path for firms to deter potential entrants and secure their market position. By making these strategic investments, firms not only enhance their own competitive advantage but also reshape the competitive landscape in their favor.",

    "text": "13.6 Conclusion\nThroughout this chapter, we’ve journeyed through the intricate landscape of game theory, unraveling how strategic interdependence underpins the competitive and cooperative dynamics of the business decisions Starting with the foundational concepts of simultaneous games, we’ve explored the pivotal roles of actions, strategies, payoffs, and equilibrium in shaping the outcomes of entrepreneurial ventures. Moving beyond the simultaneity of decisions, sequential games introduced us to the complexities of timing, revealing how the sequence of moves can dramatically alter strategic advantages and the credibility of commitments.\nStrategic commitment, as we’ve seen, stands as a beacon for entrepreneurs seeking not just to navigate but to sculpt the competitive terrain to their advantage. Whether through operational efficiency, branding, or other forms of strategic investments, the deliberate, visible, and irreversible actions taken today can deter potential competitors tomorrow, securing a more favorable position in the market landscape.\nGame theory offers more than just a theoretical framework; it provides a lens through which entrepreneurs can critically analyze and refine their strategic decisions. It teaches us the value of anticipating the moves of others, understanding the depth of strategic interdependence, and the power of committing to a course of action that reshapes the playing field in our favor.\nAs entrepreneurs, the application of game theory extends beyond academic exercises. It challenges us to think deeply about the strategies we deploy, the signals we send to the market, and the commitments we make to secure our place within it. By mastering these principles, we can turn strategic insights into competitive advantages, navigate complex market dynamics with confidence, and drive our ventures toward sustainable success.\nUncertainty often prevails in entrepreneurship but game theory stands as a guide, illuminating paths through the competitive fog. It empowers us to craft strategies that are not only individually rational but collectively advantageous, steering our ventures toward outcomes where innovation, cooperation, and strategic foresight lead the way to victory.",

    "text": "13.7 Workout Problems\n\nSeveral years ago, college football programs began evaluating upgrades to their workout and training facilities as a means to recruit better athletes. Better facilities were shown to improve the likelihood that a recruit would sign. When some top recruits signed with less prestigious schools with better facilities, rival programs were enticed to invest in upgrades to improve their recruiting. With better athletes, performance improves on the field which improves ticket sales and donations.\nAssume that BYU and the University of Utah (the U) are the only schools recruiting a particular group of athletes—this is wrong but it dramatically simplifies the game. If neither school invests in facilities, the annual return to the sports department is $20M for BYU and $15M for the U. If BYU invests but the U does not, BYU earns $25M and the U earns $7M. If the U invests but BYU does not, BYU earns $15M and the U earns $25M. If both invest, they get the same recruits they had in the past but must pay for the facilities to do it such that BYU earns $17M and the U earns $12M. Construct and solve the normal form game.\n\nWhich schools have a dominant strategy?\nWhat is BYU’s strategy?\nWhat is the equilibrium outcome?\n\nSuppose there are two existing firms in the market for baby monitors. Firm A knows how to reduce the production costs for the monitor and is considering whether to adopt the innovation or not. Innovation incurs a fixed set-up cost of \\(\\mathsf{F}\\), while increasing the revenue. However, once the new technology is adopted, another firm, B, can adopt it with a smaller set-up cost of \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{F}{2}}\\). If A innovates and B does not, A earns $20 in revenue while B earns $0. If A innovates and B does likewise, both firms earn $15 in revenue. If neither firm innovates, both earn $5.\n\nHypothesizing that Firm A will innovate, the set-up cost of the innovation ($) has to be below what value for Firm B to want to adopt? \nGiven your answer in the previous question, the set-up cost of the innovation (\\(\\mathsf{F}\\)) has to be below what value for Firm A to want to adopt? \nIf \\(\\mathsf{C = 15}\\), what is the sub-game perfect equilibrium of the game?\n\nFirm M is an existing firm in a market and firm E is a potential entrant. Firm E must decide whether to enter the market (play “enter”) or stay out of the market (play “not enter”). If firm E decides to enter the market, firm M must decide whether to engage in a price war (play “hardball”), or not (play “softball”). By playing “hardball”, firm M ensures that firm E makes a loss of $1 million, but firm M only makes $1 million in profits. On the other hand, if firm M plays “softball”, the new entrant takes half of the market, and each firm earns profits of $5 million. If firm E stays out, it earns zero while firm M earns $12 million.\n\nWhat is the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of this game?\n\nFeeling vulnerable, firm M is considering investing in market share to move down its learning curve more quickly. With lower costs, firm M is more effective at playing “hard” but less profitable in its normal operations due to cost of the investment. The payoffs of this game are as follows, with Firm M’s payoffs on the left and Firm E’s payoffs on the right:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the sub-game perfect equilibrium after considering investment in M’s learning curve?\nShould firm M make the investment?

In accounting, fixed costs that can be recovered in the future but have not yet been recovered, legally cannot be subtracted from the fixed costs. If and when the fixed cost is recovered, it will be dealt with in a new journal entry. In finance, when doing cash flow analysis before an investment, the capital outlay would not be reduced by the possibility of selling the asset at a later date. If and when the asset is sold, it would show up in the salvage value calculations at the end of the time horizon. In these cases, fixed costs and sunk costs are the same.↩︎",
