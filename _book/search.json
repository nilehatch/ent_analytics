No accounting data. No clean financial statements to lean on.

Even without accounting data, there is evidence that can be gathered, structured, and reasoned about.\nMany people try to bridge this gap using tools they already know—market sizing exercises, industry analysis frameworks, business model templates, or pro forma projections built on imagined revenue. These tools can be useful for organizing thinking, but they were not designed to estimate profit under deep uncertainty.\nAs a result, the hardest questions are often postponed until after real money has already been spent.\nThis book is about asking—and answering—those questions earlier.",

Whether to start a company, acquire a business, launch a product, invest in growth, or make a meaningful change to how an existing business operates.\nIf you’ve faced this moment, you already know the tension. The decision feels consequential, but the information you want simply isn’t there.\nThese decisions arise early, when information is thin and stakes are high. They are not abstract. They involve time, money, reputation, and responsibility to others. They shape what happens next—and just as importantly, what cannot happen later.\nAt this stage, the question is rarely framed cleanly. People talk about vision, momentum, strategy, or timing. But underneath those conversations is a simpler and more difficult question:\nIs this worth doing?\nThe pre-revenue decision moment appears in many forms.\nYou might be deciding whether to leave a stable job to pursue a new venture. You might be evaluating an acquisition target with incomplete information. You might be considering a pricing change, a new customer segment, or a fixed-cost investment that cannot easily be reversed.\nDifferent situations, same structure:\nWaiting feels prudent—but waiting has costs. Acting feels decisive—but acting feels risky. The pressure to move forward builds even as confidence remains elusive.\nThis is often the moment when people default to intuition—not because intuition is superior, but because it is available.",

It makes it harder to examine—and harder to revise.\nBefore moving on, it is worth naming something that often remains implicit.\nWhen people ask whether something is “worth doing,” they may be thinking about many things—meaning, identity, effort, or opportunity cost. But in entrepreneurship, there is usually a constraint that eventually makes the question concrete.\nAt some point, the venture must plausibly generate more value than it consumes. It must be able to pay for itself, sustain itself, and justify the commitments it requires.\nThat constraint is profit.\nProfit is not the only thing that matters, and it is rarely the first thing people want to talk about.

It asks whether an initiative justifies commitment before outcomes are known and before revenue exists.\nAt this stage, it helps to be clear about what kind of profit is under consideration.\nThis chapter is concerned with profit potential, not profit realization. Profit potential asks whether an initiative is economically worth pursuing if executed competently. Profit realization depends on execution, operations, management discipline, and time. Those uncertainties matter—but they come later. An initiative that is not worth doing economically cannot be rescued by excellent execution; one that is worth doing may still fail if executed poorly.\nEvaluating profit potential before revenue exists requires understanding why profit is uncertain and where that uncertainty comes from. Entrepreneurship involves many kinds of uncertainty, but not all of them are relevant to this early decision.\nThis chapter focuses on the uncertainty that is always present when profit must be evaluated before revenue exists. Disaggregating that uncertainty makes it possible to distinguish what must be accepted from what can be learned—and to approach the\nEntrepreneurs often describe early-stage decisions with a single phrase: “It’s uncertain.”\nThat statement is usually true—but it is rarely helpful.\nUncertainty before revenue exists is not a single condition. It is a collection of distinct unknowns that behave differently, matter in different ways, and can be addressed through different forms of learning. Treating them as interchangeable makes it harder to know what to investigate, what to accept, and what should guide judgment.\nThis chapter disaggregates profit uncertainty into its constituent parts.",

    "text": "Uncertainty, Not Risk\nThroughout this book, uncertainty refers to situations where outcomes are unknown and probabilities may not be well defined. Risk is reserved for cases where probabilities can be meaningfully assigned. Most pre-revenue decisions involve uncertainty rather than risk, even though everyday language often blurs the distinction.\nThis distinction matters because the tools used to manage risk are often ineffective—or misleading—when applied to uncertainty.\n\n\nWhy Disaggregation Matters\nWhen uncertainty is treated as a single undifferentiated obstacle, several problems follow.\nLearning becomes unfocused. Entrepreneurs gather information without clarity about which unknown they are trying to reduce. Intuition fills the gaps left by structure. And uncertainty that could have been reduced is often mistaken for uncertainty that must simply be endured.\nDisaggregating uncertainty makes it possible to ask better questions:\nWhat exactly is unknown?\nHow does this uncertainty affect profit?\nAnd could it be reduced before resources are committed?\n\n\nScope of This Chapter\nEntrepreneurship involves many forms of uncertainty. Regulations can change. Technologies can fail. Teams can underperform. Capital markets can tighten. These uncertainties are real, but they are not the focus here.\nThis chapter addresses only the uncertainty that is structurally present whenever profit must be evaluated before revenue exists—the uncertainty that stands between an idea and a responsible economic decision.\nThat uncertainty concerns: - who the relevant customer is, - how that customer values the offering, - what those preferences imply for profit, - and how others’ actions may shape outcomes.\n\n\nFour Interrelated Sources of Uncertainty\nFor the purpose of evaluating profit before revenue exists, uncertainty can be organized into four categories:\n\nCustomer uncertainty: uncertainty about which group’s behavior should anchor the analysis.\nDemand uncertainty: uncertainty about how that customer behaves economically.\nProfit uncertainty: uncertainty about economic outcomes that arises from demand interacting with prices and costs.\nStrategic uncertainty: uncertainty introduced by the actions and responses of others.\n\nThese uncertainties are distinct, but not independent. Customer choices shape demand. Demand shapes profit. Strategic interaction reshapes all three.\nUnderstanding how these uncertainties differ—and how they connect—is a prerequisite for making disciplined decisions before revenue exists. The sections that follow examine each in turn.",

    "text": "2.2 Customer Uncertainty\nBefore profit can be evaluated, there must be clarity about whose profit is being evaluated.\nThis is the role of customer uncertainty.\nCustomer uncertainty refers to uncertainty about which group of people or organizations should anchor the analysis. It is uncertainty about identification, not behavior. Until the relevant customer is specified, questions about demand, pricing, and profit remain loosely defined.\n\nWho Is the Customer?\nEntrepreneurs often speak casually about “the customer,” as if the answer were obvious. In practice, it rarely is.\nA product may appeal weakly to a large population or strongly to a small one. It may solve an acute problem for a fringe group or a mild inconvenience for a mainstream one. It may be purchased by one party and paid for by another. Each of these possibilities leads to a very different economic reality.\nCustomer uncertainty exists whenever it is unclear:\n\nwhich group’s preferences matter,\nwhose willingness to pay should be evaluated,\nand whose adoption behavior will determine outcomes.\n\nUntil these questions are resolved, profit evaluation cannot really begin.\n\n\nCustomer Uncertainty Is Not Demand Uncertainty\nCustomer uncertainty is often confused with demand uncertainty, but the two are distinct.\nCustomer uncertainty asks who the relevant customer is.\nDemand uncertainty asks how that customer behaves economically.\nThese uncertainties interact, but they should not be collapsed. It is possible to estimate demand precisely for the wrong customer group—and end up with answers that are economically meaningless.\nClarity about the customer is a prerequisite for learning about demand.\n\n\nWhy Customer Uncertainty Matters for Profit\nProfit potential depends on focusing attention and resources on the customers for whom value creation is strongest. When customer uncertainty remains unresolved, entrepreneurs often average across groups, dilute value propositions, or rely on generic market descriptions.\nThese moves can feel prudent. In reality, they often reduce clarity while creating the illusion of progress.\nA smaller group with intense need may support a profitable initiative that a larger group with weak interest cannot. Profit potential is shaped not by population size alone, but by which population is being served.\n\n\nReducing Customer Uncertainty\nCustomer uncertainty is often reducible before revenue exists. Through observation, conversation, and disciplined comparison, it is usually possible to identify which groups experience a problem acutely enough to warrant attention.\nAt this stage, the goal is not to optimize a solution or finalize a business model. It is to anchor the analysis to a clearly defined customer group whose behavior can be meaningfully studied.\nOnce that anchor is in place, the next uncertainty becomes unavoidable: how that customer values the offering, at what price, and in what quantity.\nThat uncertainty—demand uncertainty—is where the evaluation truly begins.",

    "text": "2.3 Demand Uncertainty\nOnce the relevant customer has been identified, the question usually shifts—and becomes harder.\nHow much do they actually value this?\nAt what price?\nAnd how many of them would really buy?\nThis is the domain of demand uncertainty.\nDemand uncertainty refers to uncertainty about how customers behave economically: how much they value an offering, how sensitive they are to price, and how much they would purchase under different conditions. It is not uncertainty about whether customers exist, but about how their preferences translate into economic outcomes.\nFor pre-revenue profit evaluation, this uncertainty is unavoidable—and central.\n\nWhat Demand Is (and Is Not)\nIn everyday conversation, demand is often treated loosely. People talk about interest, excitement, engagement, or positive feedback. Those signals feel reassuring, especially early on.\nEconomically, demand is more precise—and more demanding.\nDemand describes the relationship between price and quantity purchased, holding other factors constant. It answers a specific question: how many units will be purchased at a given price?\nThis means demand is not:\n\nmarket size,\nawareness,\nenthusiasm,\nor stated intent.\n\nA large market does not imply strong demand. High interest does not imply willingness to pay. Positive interviews do not imply purchase at a profitable price. These confusions are common, and they explain why demand uncertainty often feels opaque.\n\n\nWhy Demand Uncertainty Dominates Early Decisions\nBefore revenue exists, many aspects of a business can be chosen or approximated. Prices can be set. Costs can be estimated. Fixed investments can be planned.\nQuantity cannot.\nNo matter how carefully a venture is designed, customers ultimately decide how much they buy. Small errors in estimating that behavior can overwhelm reasonable assumptions about pricing or costs. As a result, uncertainty about demand often determines whether an initiative is plausibly profitable at all.\nThis is why early decisions feel so speculative. It is not because everything is unknown, but because the most important thing is.\n\n\nDemand Exists Before Revenue\nIt is easy to conclude that demand can only be known after launch, through sales and iteration. Many entrepreneurs accept this as a fact of life.\nIt is not.\nCustomers have preferences, constraints, and tradeoffs even when no product is offered for sale. While demand cannot be measured with certainty before revenue exists, it can often be bounded, structured, and compared. Some demand scenarios can be ruled out. Others can be treated as more or less plausible.\nLearning demand early does not require perfect prediction. It requires disciplined effort to reduce uncertainty where it matters most.\n\n\nDemand in Context\nDemand uncertainty sits between other uncertainties.\nCustomer uncertainty asks whose behavior matters.\nDemand uncertainty asks how that customer behaves economically.\nProfit uncertainty reflects how that behavior interacts with prices and costs.\nWhen these uncertainties are blurred together, effort is often misallocated. Entrepreneurs refine customer descriptions without learning about willingness to pay, or build detailed cost models without anchoring quantity. In both cases, work is done without reducing the uncertainty that drives the decision.\n\n\nA Question to Carry Forward\nAt this point, you may notice a tension.\nDemand feels essential, but also difficult to learn without committing resources. Yet treating it as unknowable pushes decisions toward guessing. The chapters that follow take up this tension directly.\nFor now, a simpler question is enough:\nWhat would you need to learn about demand for this decision to feel responsible rather than hopeful?",

    "text": "2.4 Profit Uncertainty\nOnce customer and demand uncertainty are on the table, profit uncertainty becomes unavoidable.\nThis is often the point where conversations become vague. People say things like “the economics are unclear” or “we’ll figure out profitability later.” What they usually mean is that they are unsure how what they’ve learned so far translates into money.\nProfit uncertainty is not mysterious. It is simply the uncertainty that arises when uncertain demand interacts with prices and costs.\n\nWhat Profit Uncertainty Is\nProfit uncertainty refers to uncertainty about economic outcomes—whether an initiative can plausibly generate surplus after accounting for what it costs to operate.\nUnlike demand uncertainty, profit uncertainty is not about customer behavior alone. It reflects how that behavior combines with choices the firm controls: pricing, cost structure, and scale.\nThis distinction matters.\nDemand uncertainty asks: How many units would customers buy at a given price?\nProfit uncertainty asks: Would that level of demand justify proceeding, given what it costs to serve it?\nThese questions are related, but they are not the same.\n\n\nWhy Profit Feels Harder Than Demand\nMany entrepreneurs find profit uncertainty more intimidating than demand uncertainty. Demand at least feels like a customer problem—something that can be explored through conversation, observation, or testing. Profit feels abstract, numerical, and distant.\nThis reaction is understandable, but misleading.\nProfit uncertainty feels difficult not because it is fundamentally different, but because it aggregates several moving parts. Prices must be chosen. Costs must be estimated. Fixed investments must be contemplated. Each introduces assumptions, and assumptions compound.\nWhat often gets lost is that most of the uncertainty in profit comes from demand, not from costs or pricing mechanics. Prices are chosen by the firm. Costs are constrained by operational decisions. Quantity is not.\n\n\nWhy Profit Uncertainty Cannot Be Ignored\nIt is tempting to postpone profit questions until demand feels more certain. Many teams do. They focus on traction, engagement, or growth, assuming that profitability can be addressed once momentum exists.\nThis postponement carries risk.\nInvestments in features, infrastructure, hiring, or growth paths implicitly assume a future profit profile. When those assumptions are not examined early, resources are committed without clarity about whether the underlying economics can support them.\nEvaluating profit potential early does not require precise forecasts. It requires understanding whether plausible demand scenarios support outcomes that justify commitment.\n\n\nProfit Potential Versus Profit Realization\nAt this stage, it is worth returning to a distinction introduced earlier: profit potential versus profit realization.\nProfit uncertainty at the pre-revenue stage is about potential, not execution. It asks whether an initiative is economically worth pursuing if carried out competently. It does not ask whether the team will execute perfectly or whether every operational challenge can be overcome.\nExecution matters. But it cannot rescue an initiative whose economics are fundamentally weak.\nSeparating these questions allows profit uncertainty to be examined without conflating it with every other source of difficulty in entrepreneurship.\n\n\nA Question to Carry Forward\nAt this point, profit uncertainty should feel less opaque—even if it remains unresolved.\nYou may not know what demand will be. You may not yet know what prices or costs will ultimately be chosen. But you can ask a more disciplined question than “Will this work?”\nInstead:\nGiven what I know about demand so far, are there plausible paths to profit that would justify continued investment—or is the economics itself the constraint?",

They concern identifying the right customer, understanding how that customer values the offering, and assessing whether plausible demand could support profit.\nStrategic uncertainty enters when outcomes depend not only on customers, but on the actions of others.\n\nWhat Strategic Uncertainty Is\nStrategic uncertainty refers to uncertainty about how other decision-makers will act and how those actions will affect outcomes. Competitors may change prices, add features, reposition offerings, or enter or exit the market. Partners may renegotiate terms. Customers may gain alternatives.\nUnlike demand uncertainty, strategic uncertainty does not arise from preferences alone. It arises from interaction.\nThis distinction matters because interaction changes the logic of evaluation. When outcomes depend on others’ choices, profit is shaped not only by what customers want, but by how firms respond to one another.\n\n\nWhen Strategic Uncertainty Matters—and When It Doesn’t\nNot every initiative is meaningfully shaped by strategic interaction.\nIn some cases, strategic uncertainty is minimal. Early-stage products may face no direct competitors. Niche offerings may serve customers others overlook. Temporary advantages may exist due to timing, access, or novelty.\nIn these situations, assuming away strategic interaction can be reasonable—at least initially. Doing so simplifies evaluation and focuses attention where it belongs.\nIn other cases, strategic uncertainty is unavoidable. Markets may already be competitive. Rivals may respond quickly to changes in price or features. Customers may switch easily between alternatives. In these environments, ignoring strategic interaction leads to fragile conclusions.\nThe challenge is not to eliminate strategic uncertainty, but to recognize when it is relevant and when it can be safely bracketed.\n\n\nStrategic Uncertainty Is Not an Excuse to Avoid Evaluation\nBecause strategic interaction is complex, it is often treated as a reason not to evaluate profit at all. People say things like “it depends on what competitors do” and stop there.\nThis reaction is understandable—but incomplete.\nStrategic uncertainty complicates evaluation, but it does not make it impossible. It changes the questions that must be asked. Instead of evaluating a single outcome, entrepreneurs must consider how outcomes vary across plausible responses by others.\nImportantly, strategic uncertainty does not eliminate the need to understand demand. It builds on it. Competitive interaction reshapes demand and profit; it does not replace them.\n\n\nWhy Strategic Uncertainty Comes After Demand and Profit\nIt is tempting to begin with competition. Many strategy frameworks do. But for pre-revenue profit evaluation, this ordering often obscures more than it reveals.\nWithout a grounded understanding of demand, strategic scenarios are untethered. Competitive responses cannot be evaluated meaningfully without knowing how customers value alternatives, how sensitive they are to price, and how substitution occurs.\nFor this reason, strategic uncertainty is best addressed after customer, demand and profit uncertainty are clarified—not before.\n\n\nA Question to Carry Forward\nAt this stage, it is enough to recognize whether strategic uncertainty belongs in the picture at all.\nBefore asking how competitors might respond, a simpler question is more useful:\nIf others reacted in reasonable but unfavorable ways, would the profit potential still justify proceeding—or is this initiative only attractive in the absence of response?",

    "text": "2.6 Reducible and Irreducible Uncertainty\nBy now, it should be clear that uncertainty before revenue exists is not a single obstacle. It comes from different sources, affects decisions in different ways, and deserves to be treated with care rather than resignation.\nThe final distinction that matters is between reducible and irreducible uncertainty.\n\nWhat Can and Cannot Be Reduced\nSome uncertainty cannot be resolved before action is taken. Competitors may behave unpredictably. Markets may shift. Technologies may evolve. These uncertainties are real, and no amount of analysis can eliminate them.\nThis is irreducible uncertainty. It must be accepted and managed through judgment, flexibility, and resilience.\nOther uncertainty, however, exists only because the relevant questions have not yet been asked—or the effort to learn has not yet been made.\nThis is reducible uncertainty.\nCustomer uncertainty is often reducible. With disciplined exploration, it is usually possible to determine which groups experience a problem acutely and are worth anchoring the analysis to.\nDemand uncertainty is frequently reducible as well. While it cannot be eliminated, it can often be bounded, compared, and structured in ways that rule out implausible scenarios and clarify what is economically at stake.\nProfit uncertainty, because it is largely driven by demand uncertainty, is often reducible to the same extent.\nStrategic uncertainty is more mixed. In some contexts it can be bracketed temporarily. In others it must be confronted directly. Recognizing which case you are in is itself a form of learning.\n\n\nThe Common Mistake\nA common mistake in entrepreneurship is to treat all uncertainty as irreducible.\nWhen this happens, evaluation is abandoned prematurely. Decisions are justified with stories rather than evidence. Guessing is reframed as courage. Failure is reframed as inevitable.\nThis mindset is often defended as realism. In practice, it reflects a failure to distinguish what must be accepted from what could have been learned.\nReducing uncertainty before revenue exists does not mean eliminating risk. It means avoiding unnecessary ignorance.\n\n\nWhat Reduction Actually Looks Like\nReducing uncertainty does not require precision. It does not require forecasts with decimal points or confidence intervals. It requires clarity about what matters and what would change the decision.\nOften, a small amount of learning goes a long way. Ruling out a single demand scenario, identifying a price range that will not work, or discovering that a customer group is less responsive than expected can dramatically alter the evaluation.\nThe goal is not certainty. The goal is responsible judgment.\n\n\nMaking the Call Under Uncertainty\nEvery entrepreneurial decision is made under uncertainty. That will not change.\nWhat can change is whether uncertainty is confronted deliberately or endured passively. By disaggregating uncertainty and reducing what can be reduced, entrepreneurs gain the ability to make decisions they can stand behind—even when outcomes remain unknown.\nWith this landscape in view, the next step is clear. If demand uncertainty is central, and if it is often reducible, then learning about demand before revenue exists becomes the core task.\nThe chapters that follow take up that task directly.",

    "text": "3.1 “Is This Worth Doing?” Is a Profit Question\nBy this point, it should be clear that when entrepreneurs ask whether something is “worth doing,” they are not asking an abstract or philosophical question. They are asking whether an initiative can plausibly justify the commitments it will require.\nIn practice, that question turns on profit.\nProfit is not the only thing that matters in entrepreneurship, but it is the constraint that makes the decision real. A venture that cannot plausibly generate profit cannot sustain itself, cannot scale responsibly, and cannot support the irreversible choices it will eventually demand.\nFor this reason, the question of worth is inseparable from the question of profit—even before revenue exists.",

    "text": "The Mistake of Postponing the Profit Question\nDespite this, most entrepreneurship advice encourages people to postpone profit questions.\nThe usual logic is that profit is unknowable early on, so it is better to focus on learning, experimentation, growth, or traction, and to worry about economics later. In practice, this often means building first and asking hard questions second.\nThis approach feels reasonable because early ventures lack the data people normally associate with profit: revenue histories, cost reports, margins, and financial statements. Without those numbers, profit can feel speculative at best and meaningless at worst.\nFrom this, many people conclude—explicitly or implicitly—that profit simply cannot be evaluated before launch.\nThat conclusion is understandable. It is also wrong.\nPostponing the profit question does not eliminate it. It defers it until more resources have been spent, more commitments have been made, and fewer options remain. By the time profit is confronted directly, the cost of being wrong is often much higher.\nAsking whether something is worth doing only after those commitments are in place is not prudence. It is surrender.\n\n\nProfit as a Decision Object, Not an Outcome\nAnother source of confusion is the belief that profit can only be assessed after the fact.\nIn accounting, profit is a realized outcome, recorded once transactions have occurred. In entrepreneurship, profit must be treated differently. Decisions about pricing, investment, scale, features, positioning, and timing must all be made before outcomes are known.\nThose decisions implicitly assume future profit. Whether or not that assumption is made explicit, it is always present.\nEvery decision to proceed, delay, invest, or walk away carries an implicit judgment about whether the initiative is worth doing economically.\nThe question, then, is not whether profit judgments will be made.\nThe question is how they will be made.\nThey can be made implicitly, through intuition, analogy, and hope.\nOr they can be made explicitly, through evidence, analysis, and disciplined reasoning under uncertainty.\nThis book is about the second approach.\n\n\nWhy This Question Must Be Asked Early\nEvaluating profit before revenue exists is uncomfortable because it forces clarity in the absence of certainty. It requires separating what is chosen from what is unknown, and what is unknowable from what can still be learned.\nThat discomfort is not a sign that the question is premature. It is a sign that the question is essential.\nEntrepreneurship does not become less uncertain by waiting. It becomes more constrained. The earlier profit-relevant questions are asked, the more freedom there is to act on the answers—whether that means proceeding with confidence, changing course, or deciding not to proceed at all.\nTo reason about profit before revenue exists, however, we must first understand why it feels so difficult—and where the uncertainty actually lives. That work begins by looking carefully at the structure of profit itself.",

    "text": "3.2 The Profit Equation as an Epistemic Map\nWhen people think about profit, they often think about accounting. Income statements, margins, and cash flows come to mind. Those tools are indispensable once a business is operating.\nBefore revenue exists, they offer little help.\nTo understand profit before revenue, we need a different lens.\nA simple profit equation provides that starting point:\n\\[ \\mathsf{\\pi} = \\mathsf{pq - cq - f}. \\]\nThis equation is not new. What matters here is not its novelty, but how it helps us see profit.\nUsed properly, the profit equation is not a calculation. It is an epistemic map—a way to locate uncertainty and distinguish what is chosen from what tells us something about the world.\n\nWhat Is Chosen and What Is Unknown\nBefore a business launches, most elements of the profit equation are the result of decisions.\nPrice is chosen by the firm. Whether pricing is simple or complex, fixed or dynamic, it is ultimately a decision variable. Firms may not know the “right” price in advance, but they are not ignorant of price altogether.\nCosts are also largely chosen. Variable costs reflect design and operational decisions. Fixed costs reflect commitments to capacity, infrastructure, and overhead. These choices may be constrained, but they are not unknown in the same way demand is.\nQuantity is different.\nQuantity is not chosen by the firm. It is revealed through customer behavior.\nIt depends on how many customers exist, whether they care, what they are willing to pay, and how sensitive they are to price and alternatives. Before revenue exists, quantity is the only element of the profit equation that cannot be set by decision alone.\nThis is the central insight:\nBefore revenue exists, profit uncertainty is almost entirely demand uncertainty.\n\n\nWhy This Insight Matters\nEarly-stage ventures often feel uncertain in every direction. Markets are unfamiliar. Customers are unknown. Competition is unpredictable. Costs may change. The future feels opaque.\nThe profit equation helps discipline that feeling.\nIt shows that much of what feels uncertain is actually the result of choice. Pricing, cost structure, and investment levels are not mysteries waiting to be solved by the market. They are commitments the firm makes.\nDemand is different. Demand must be learned.\nRecognizing this allows effort to become focused rather than diffuse. Instead of treating everything as equally unknowable, attention can be directed to the uncertainty that actually determines whether a venture is worth doing.",

    "text": "3.3 Why the Obvious Tools Fail at This Question\nAt this point, a reasonable reaction is to ask:\nSo how do people usually try to answer this?\nEntrepreneurs are not short on tools. In fact, most people confronting an early-stage profit decision reach for frameworks that are familiar, widely taught, and socially validated. These tools feel serious. They feel responsible.\nThe problem is not that these tools are useless. The problem is that they were not designed to answer the question at hand.\n\nAccounting: Useful Too Late\nAccounting data is extremely useful—after a business has revenue.\nIncome statements, margins, and cash flows tell you what has already happened. They are backward-looking by design. Before a venture operates, there are no transactions to record and no profits to observe.\nAttempts to “do accounting early” usually involve inventing numbers that resemble accounting outputs. These numbers borrow the authority of accounting without its empirical foundation. They look rigorous, but they do not evaluate profit.\nThe absence of accounting data before revenue exists is not a temporary inconvenience. It is a structural fact.\n\n\nFive Forces: Structure Without Outcomes\nPorter’s Five Forces framework helps describe competitive pressure. It organizes thinking around rivalry, entry, substitutes, buyer power, and supplier power. As a descriptive tool, it can be useful.\nWhat it does not do is estimate profit.\nFive Forces contains no prices, no quantities, and no link between competitive structure and economic outcomes. Assessments of force strength are ultimately subjective, and two industries that look similar on Five Forces can support very different profit potential for a specific venture.\nThe framework classifies environments. It does not evaluate opportunities.\n\n\nBusiness Model Canvas: Description Without Evaluation\nThe Business Model Canvas helps people articulate how a business is supposed to work. It is useful for communication and alignment.\nIt does not answer whether the business will make money.\nYou can fill in every box, validate every assumption, and still lose money. The canvas describes components, not economic consequences. It contains no mechanism for estimating willingness to pay, price sensitivity, or quantity sold.\nCoherence is not the same as viability.\n\n\nTAM, SAM, SOM: Scale Without Demand\nMarket sizing frameworks are among the most common tools used in early evaluation. They are easy to compute, easy to present, and easy to believe.\nThey do not estimate profit.\nTAM, SAM, and SOM focus on scale, not value. To get from market size to profit, one must assume a market share of an imagined market at an imagined price. Quantity sold is never learned; it is assumed.\nThese frameworks work best when entering stable, well-understood markets. They break down precisely in the kinds of settings where new ventures and new business models operate.\n\n\nPro Forma NPV: Precision Built on Guesses\nPro forma cash flows and discounted cash flow analysis are explicitly profit-oriented, which is their appeal.\nBut every number inside them is an assumption.\nPrices are guessed. Costs are guessed. Growth rates are guessed. Most importantly, quantity sold is almost always assumed rather than estimated. Discounting does not solve this problem; it simply adds mathematical precision to uncertainty.\nThe output reflects the inputs. When the inputs are guesses, the output is a refined guess.\n\n\nThe Pattern\nStepping back, a pattern emerges.\nNone of these tools estimate demand.\nQuantity sold is never learned.\nThis is not because entrepreneurs are careless or unsophisticated. It is because they are using the best tools they have been given—and those tools were never designed to learn demand.\nThe profit equation makes this visible. If profit uncertainty before revenue exists is primarily uncertainty about q, then tools that never engage with q cannot answer the question of whether a business is worth doing.\nThis book begins from that recognition and takes a different starting point.",

If nothing has been sold, how can profit be evaluated at all?\nThe answer is that evaluation does not require observation.\nBefore revenue exists, profit cannot be measured. But it can be evaluated—by understanding the relationships among price, quantity, and costs, and by forming disciplined judgments about the range of outcomes those relationships imply.\nTreating profit as unknowable until it appears on a financial statement confuses realization with reasoning.\nEntrepreneurs do not have the luxury of waiting for realization.

    "text": "4.7 Why Study Demand?\nSuccessful innovations hinge on being desirable, feasible, and viable. These aspects are interdependent. If an innovation lacks desirability, feasibility alone can’t save it. If it’s not feasible, it can’t meet the desired level of performance. Without desirability and feasibility, viability is unattainable because it can’t sustainably fulfill customer needs. This interplay among desirability, feasibility, and viability defines entrepreneurship as an economic activity, where success is measured by value creation and long-term profitability.\nValue isn’t limited to financial profit; it can encompass outcomes like health, dignity, comfort, or spirituality, particularly in ventures with non-profit missions. Even when value isn’t financial, it’s often referred to as profit for measurement purposes, and profitability is a key success metric.\nProfit is typically calculated as revenue minus cost, expressed as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathsf{\\pi} &= \\mathsf{Revenue - Cost} \\\\        \n     &= \\mathsf{R - C} \\\\        \n     &= \\mathsf{PQ - cQ -F}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathsf{\\pi}\\) represents profit, \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) is revenue, \\(\\mathsf{C}\\) is cost, \\(\\mathsf{P}\\) is price, \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) is quantity, \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is variable cost, and \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) is fixed cost. To achieve viability, a venture must consistently generate positive profit. Notably, the quantity variable \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) represents demand for the solution at the price \\(\\mathsf{P}\\). Demand is a foundational factor in assessing expected profitability.\nThe surest route to entrepreneurial success is identifying customers with a genuine need and addressing it with a solution. Regardless of the innovation’s technical superiority or other accolades, without customer demand, it won’t succeed commercially. “Better” must be defined in terms of solving customer problems.\nFrom an economic perspective, discovering customer problems equates to finding demand curves. When customers have a problem they want solved, they will “demand” your solution. Conversely, if there’s no demand, even the most remarkable solution will fail commercially. Finding your customers’ demand curve for your solution and analyzing price and revenue potential based on it is crucial.\nIn established companies, profit components are derived from accounting data. However, in startups, evidence-based decisions require calculating expected profit using demand. In this chapter, we’ll delve into demand curves, their properties, and, most importantly, how to collect customer preference data to identify the demand curve. Armed with this knowledge, we can construct revenue, cost, and profit curves to assess the long-term viability of the venture.",

    "section": "4.8 Demand Curves",
    "text": "4.8 Demand Curves\nA demand curve is a critical concept in understanding customer behavior and revenue generation. It represents the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity customers are willing to buy. Let’s break it down further:\n\nDemand Curve Definition: A demand curve is essentially a graph or mathematical equation that shows how much customers value a product at different prices. In its simplest form, it can be expressed as \\(\\mathsf{Q = a - bP}\\), where \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) is the quantity, and \\(\\mathsf{P}\\) is the price. For example, Figure 5.1 shows this demand curve graphically. The intercept is 2000 units meaning that 2000 units will be sold when price is $0. For every dollar increase in price, demand falls by 2 units. This demand curve implies that at a price of $750, customers will buy 500 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Demand Curve: Q = 2000 - 2P\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Demand: The law of demand states that as the price of a product rises, customers tend to buy less of it, and as the price falls, they buy more. This aligns with common shopping behavior: when something becomes more expensive, we often seek alternatives.\nFactors Influencing Demand: While price is a significant factor, demand curves can be influenced by other variables like income, advertising, and the prices of other goods. A complete demand curve takes these factors into account through a more complex equation, such as \\[\\mathsf{Q_x(P_x) = a - bP_x + cP_y + dM + \\ldots}\\]where \\(\\mathsf{P_x}\\) is the price of the product in question, \\(\\mathsf{P_y}\\) is the price of another good, and \\(\\mathsf{M}\\) is income.\nChanges in Demand vs. Quantity Demanded: When factors other than the price of the product change, the entire demand curve shifts. As Figure 5.2 illustrates, this movement from point A to C is known as a change in demand. Conversely, a change in quantity demanded occurs when only the price of the product changes, causing movement along the demand curve from point A to B. For example, an increase in income might lead to a higher demand for a product, shifting the demand. This distinction is important when we work with demand curves with more variables than just price. As you may intuit from the graph, the effect of non-price variables is to change the intercept of the demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Change in Demand vs. Change in Quantity Demanded\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand curves are powerful tools for understanding customer behavior and making informed business decisions. They help businesses set appropriate prices, predict customer responses to price changes, and identify the impact of various external factors on product demand.",

    "text": "4.9 Price Sensitivity\nIn traditional economics, much emphasis is placed on the concept of price elasticity, which measures how sensitive customers are to changes in prices. Price-sensitive customers are always on the lookout for discounts and quickly reduce their purchases when prices rise slightly. For well-established companies with ample transaction data and small, infrequent price changes, studying price sensitivity through elasticity makes sense—it helps optimize profit.\nHowever, in the entrepreneurial context, where we often lack transaction data and need to directly engage with customers to estimate demand curves across a wide price range, a different approach is more practical. Rather than analyzing price sensitivity indirectly through elasticity, we will focus on how to directly find and estimate demand curves. This approach allows us to analyze everything we need without the need for elasticity calculations.\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into elasticity, you can explore the appendix in ?sec-elasticity.",

    "text": "4.10 Where do we get demand curves?\nIn the realm of economics, demand curves play a pivotal role in understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics. These curves provide insights into how consumers respond to changes in prices and other variables, guiding businesses in their decision-making processes. However, acquiring accurate demand curves has often been regarded as a complex task, typically requiring the expertise of economists and statisticians with advanced degrees. Large corporations usually have the resources to employ such experts, enabling them to make informed strategic choices based on well-defined demand curves.\nYet, the landscape is different for most businesses, especially entrepreneurial startups. These ventures often lack the luxury of dedicated economists and statisticians, making them vulnerable to competitive pressures resulting from less-informed decisions. Traditionally, in economics education, students are cautioned about the challenges of statistically determining demand curves. These curves can be elusive due to various factors, including the complex interplay between supply and demand, historical data biases, and endogeneity. As a result, economics textbooks and courses typically provide demand curves as given, and students are not encouraged to delve into the intricate process of estimating them.\nThe good news, however, is that startups can sidestep the complexities traditionally associated with estimating demand curves. In the modern business landscape, many entrepreneurs are already collecting data as part of their efforts to validate their business models. This process, often referred to as customer development, revolves around confirming whether customers indeed face the problems that a solution aims to address and whether they genuinely desire that solution. If customers do not resonate with the problem-solution fit, entrepreneurs will likely encounter limited demand and customers who are highly price-sensitive.\nSo, how can startups navigate the demand curve challenge without the need for specialized economists? The answer lies in understanding the concept of “willingness to pay.” Think of a demand curve as a lineup of your customers, standing shoulder to shoulder, ranked in descending order of their willingness to pay – the maximum amount a customer would be willing to pay for a unit of your solution. In essence, willingness to pay is equivalent to a price point.\nBy harnessing your knowledge of customers’ willingness to pay, you already possess the fundamental elements necessary to estimate a demand curve. This process is more straightforward and less prone to the statistical complexities associated with traditional demand curve estimation. It primarily involves three steps:\n\nCollect willingness to pay Data: Gather data on customers’ willingness to pay, effectively using it as a proxy for price.\nUse willingness to pay Data for Quantity Calculation: Utilize the willingness to pay data to calculate the corresponding quantities customers are willing to purchase at various price points.\nEstimate the Demand Curve: Apply regression analysis to the price-quantity data, allowing you to construct an accurate demand curve. In the subsequent sections, we will delve into these steps in greater detail, exploring how to obtain the data and transform it into valuable insights for your startup.\n\n\nCollect Willingness to Pay Data\nGaining insights into your customers’ willingness to pay is crucial for understanding demand. To collect this data effectively, follow these steps:\n\nDescribe the Solution: Begin by providing a comprehensive description of your product or service. Ensure respondents understand your solution as if they were making a purchase. Even in the early stages, offer the best and most recent description possible.\nAsk Customers Their Willingness to Pay: After describing the solution, convey your commitment to addressing your customers’ problems and improving their lives through your solution. Ask them, “What is the most you would be willing to pay for this solution?” Record their responses, preferably in a spreadsheet.\n\nKeep in mind that respondents may provide flawed estimates as they may not fully consider all factors involved in an actual transaction. Some may overestimate their willingness to pay during a survey, while others may underestimate it. However, willingness to pay data still provides remarkably accurate insights into demand.\n\nAvoid softening the question by naming a specific price and asking if they would buy at that price, as this limits the richness of the data you can gather. Remember that asking this question is not impolite when you genuinely offer a solution to a real problem. Non-customers’ responses, which tend to be biased, should be avoided as they may lead to incorrect validation or rejection of your idea.\n\n\nMinimize Sampling Bias: Gather data primarily from your target customers to avoid non-relevant responses that can distort your findings.\nSample Enough Customers: While a larger sample size is generally better, focus more on refining your understanding of the questions and sampling the right customers. Small, inexpensive samples (30–50 responses) are suitable for refining your understanding, but larger, more expensive samples are needed when seeking a representative demand curve.\n\n\nCollect Customer Characteristic Data: Over time, your understanding of your customers will evolve. To aid this process, request basic demographic information, such as age, gender, income level, education, job category, and geography. As you refine your hypotheses, add new questions about customer characteristics to narrow your focus to real customers while minimizing bias in your sampling.\n\nBy gathering willingness to pay data and continually refining your understanding of your customers, you can better identify your target audience and tailor your efforts to serve them effectively.\n\n\nUse Willingness to Pay Data to Calculate Quantity\nAs established in Section 5.2, a demand curve essentially illustrates the relationship between price and the quantity that consumers are willing to consume at that price. Willingness to pay data provides a proxy for price but where do we get the quantity variable? Let’s look first at the class of products known as durable goods which, as the name implies, are items that endure over time and are not fully consumed in their initial use, such as cars, personal computers, or houses.\nTypically, consumers do not purchase more than one unit of a durable good within a short time frame because these products provide sustained value. Consequently, when dealing with durable goods, the quantity of consumers willing to buy is often synonymous with the quantity of the product sold at a given price. In simpler terms, you can count the number of consumers willing to buy at a specific price, and that number represents the quantity demanded at that price.\nLet’s consider a sample of willingness to pay data to illustrate this concept. Willingness to pay responses for 27 respondents are given in Table 5.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrespondent\nwtp\n\n\n\n\n1\n15.00\n\n\n2\n5.00\n\n\n3\n20.00\n\n\n4\n15.00\n\n\n5\n12.00\n\n\n6\n0.00\n\n\n7\n10.00\n\n\n8\n35.00\n\n\n9\n17.00\n\n\n10\n0.00\n\n\n11\n20.00\n\n\n12\n0.00\n\n\n13\n22.99\n\n\n14\n25.00\n\n\n15\n15.00\n\n\n16\n0.00\n\n\n17\n10.00\n\n\n18\n15.00\n\n\n19\n0.00\n\n\n20\n0.00\n\n\n21\n20.00\n\n\n22\n3.00\n\n\n23\n15.00\n\n\n24\n30.00\n\n\n25\n15.00\n\n\n26\n20.00\n\n\n27\n23.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Willingness to pay for each of 27 respondents.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, you can observe that two respondents were willing to pay $30 or more for the product, and six out of 27 respondents indicated they would not pay anything, which raises concerns about non-target customers.\nThe first step in converting this willingness to pay data into quantity data is to count how frequently the unique values of willingness to pay were named. In our example, there are 13 unique values of willingness to pay named by the 27 respondents. The unique values and the count of how frequently they were named are given in Table 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtp\ncount\n\n\n\n\n0.00\n6\n\n\n3.00\n1\n\n\n5.00\n1\n\n\n10.00\n2\n\n\n12.00\n1\n\n\n15.00\n6\n\n\n17.00\n1\n\n\n20.00\n4\n\n\n22.99\n1\n\n\n23.00\n1\n\n\n25.00\n1\n\n\n30.00\n1\n\n\n35.00\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Unique values of willingness to pay for the product named by the respondents and a count of how frequently each willingness to pay value was named.\n\n\n\n\nCount is similar to quantity but will not really serve as a measure of quantity because it neglects the impact of the law of demand. If you were to accept count as your quantity variable, your demand curve would imply that six units are consumed at a price of $15.00 but only one unit is consumed at a price of $12. The law of demand requires that quantity increase as price falls so count violates that law. We can restate the law of demand to say that anyone who would buy at a higher price would also buy at a lower price. This means that the respondent who is willing to pay $35 is also willing to pay $30 and should be included in the quantity data for $30; the respondent who is willing to pay \\$30 and the respondent who is willing to pay \\$35 are both also willing to pay \\$25 and should be included in the quantity data for \\$25; and so on.\nTo calculate the quantity, start with the highest willingness to pay respondent and use that count as quantity. For the next highest willingness to pay value, add the count of that price to the quantity of the higher willingness to pay respondent. Continue accumulating these values through the lowest willingness to pay value.This cumulative sum approach ensures that the quantity at a lower price includes respondents who are also willing to buy at higher prices, adhering to the law of demand. The resulting price-quantity data can be used to estimate the demand curve for the durable good. The quantity and count variables are shown together with the willingness to pay variable in Table Table 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtp\ncount\nquantity\n\n\n\n\n35.00\n1\n1\n\n\n30.00\n1\n2\n\n\n25.00\n1\n3\n\n\n23.00\n1\n4\n\n\n22.99\n1\n5\n\n\n20.00\n4\n9\n\n\n17.00\n1\n10\n\n\n15.00\n6\n16\n\n\n12.00\n1\n17\n\n\n10.00\n2\n19\n\n\n5.00\n1\n20\n\n\n3.00\n1\n21\n\n\n0.00\n6\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Willingness to pay, count, and quantity data for demand estimation.\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, here’s a step-by-step approach to obtain quantity data from willingness to pay data:\n\nSort the willingness to pay data in ascending order.\nCount the number of respondents willing to pay at each unique price point.\nCalculate the quantity demanded at each price by cumulatively summing the count data.\n\n\n\nEstimate the Demand Curve\nIn the process of constructing a function of the expected profit to be earned by an innovation, we need the demand curve as the first building block. The demand curve is an equation that shows the quantity demanded at every price. We have data from representative consumers showing prices and the quantities that will be demanded at those prices. We need to convert those data into an equation, and to do that, we will use linear regression.\nThere are literally dozens of choices of software that will estimate the demand curve equation from price-quantity data. This book gives a detailed explanation of the process using three common analytics platforms: spreadsheet, R, and Python. Depending on your skills and preferences, choose your preferred platform and learn the details about using that platform for estimating the demand curve through regression. In this chapter, we will remain neutral about the estimation platform and invite it to you to explore the particulars of your preferred platform in the supplementary documents dedicated to your platform. For example, throughout this book on entrepreneurship analytics, we will study the expected profitability of Muscle Cola, a hypothetical protein infused soft drink that provides protein replenishment and refreshment after a workout.\nAt this stage, we will just report the demand estimation of the data collected and reported above and consider how to interpret the regression results as the demand equation. While regression results are reported differently by different analytics platforms, they all have the same components: the regression estimates of the variable coefficients, standard errors of the estimated coefficients, t-statistics for the estimated coefficients, and a variety of measures of the goodness of the statistical fit.\nLet’s dig into the regression results for the quantity demanded of a durable good as a function of price. The data for this regression model were presented in Table 5.3. There, willingness to pay (wtp) serves as a proxy for the independent, predictor variable of price. Changes in the dependent variable quantity are caused by changes in price. We use linear regression as a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. In a linear relationship, one variable changes at a constant rate relative to another \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 x}\\). This relationship can be visualized through a straight line when the data is plotted on a graph, hence the term “linear.”\nLet’s start our analysis of the demand curve by visualizing of the relationship between our dependent variable quantity and our independent variable wtp in a scatterplot. This scatterplot is shown in Figure 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Scatterplot of the relationship between price and quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, the relationship looks linear and the impact of wtp on quantity seems clear and strongly negative as we would expect.\n\nUse Linear Regression Analysis\nUsing regression, we can get the specific linear equation of the relationship between price and quantity sold.  Linear regression is employed to fit linear models to datasets, enabling the analysis of the relationship between two or more variables by choosing coefficients that minimize the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.\nModel Interpretation: The summary of the linear model gives details about the coefficients of the equation, error estimates, and other statistical measures. Interpreting the summary of a linear regression model involves evaluating various statistical metrics to understand the model’s performance and validity. Here are the key components:\n\nEstimate: These are the estimated coefficients of the model. In the context of a simple linear regression model \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1\\ x_1}\\), \\(\\mathsf{b_0}\\) is the y-intercept (the value of \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) when \\(\\mathsf{x = 0}\\)), and \\(\\mathsf{b_1}\\) is the slope, indicating the change in \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) for a one-unit change in \\(\\mathsf{x}\\).\nStd. Error: This measures the variability in the estimate for the coefficient. Lower values indicate more reliable estimates.\nt value: It’s the coefficient divided by its standard error. It tests the hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero (no effect). A t-value of 2 would indicate that the coefficient is two standard errors away from 0.\nPr(&gt;|t|) or p-value: A low p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero.\n\nIn other words, a low p-value gives you confidence that the relationship between \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) is not just random correlation.\n\nIn fact, the p-value can be interpreted as the level of confidence you can have: p = 0.05 means that there is only a five percent chance that the relationship is actually random rather than a meaningful relationship where \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) is influencing \\(\\mathsf{y}\\).\n\nWe typically say that we have 95 percent confidence about the estimate in this case.\nTechnically, this means that if we repeated the data collection and estimation 100 times, we would expect that in five of the 100 cases our estimate would actually be zero rather than the estimated coefficient.\n\n\nIn addition to examining individual coefficients, understanding the overall fit of a linear regression model is crucial. The summary of a linear regression model provides essential statistics to assess the model’s performance and validity. Here are key components related to the overall model fit:\n\nR-squared: R-squared is a measure of how well the independent variables explain the variability in the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.\n\nAn R-squared value of 0.0 indicates that the model explains none of the variance, while an R-squared of 1.0 means that the model explains all of the variance.\nFor example, if R-squared is 0.80, it suggests that 80% of the variance in the dependent variable can be attributed to the independent variables included in the model.\nR-squared is often interpreted as the goodness of fit, where higher values indicate a better fit.\n\nF-statistic: The F-statistic assesses the overall significance of the regression model. It tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients in the model are equal to zero, meaning that the independent variables have no effect on the dependent variable.\n\nA high F-statistic indicates that the model as a whole is statistically significant, meaning that at least one of the independent variables is contributing significantly to explaining the variance in the dependent variable.\nThe F-statistic is associated with a p-value (typically ≤ 0.05), and a low p-value suggests that the model is statistically significant.\nIf the F-statistic is significant, it implies that the regression equation, as a whole, provides meaningful information about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n\n\nIn summary, R-squared provides insight into how well the independent variables collectively explain the variation in the dependent variable. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit. The F-statistic and its associated p-value evaluate whether the model, as a whole, is statistically significant. If the p-value is low, it suggests that the model is meaningful and provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variables.\n\n\nEstimating Demand for the Willingness to Pay Data\nConsider the output from the regression of our transformed data on quantity and price, using the lm function from R.\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = quantity ~ wtp, data = wtp_q_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.9395 -1.6873 -0.3017  1.8244  3.5091 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept) 25.04943    1.18871   21.07 3.05e-10 ***\nwtp         -0.78739    0.06062  -12.99 5.13e-08 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 2.222 on 11 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.9388,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.9332 \nF-statistic: 168.7 on 1 and 11 DF,  p-value: 5.13e-08\n\n\n\n#install.packages(\"gtsummary\")\n#library(gtsummary)\n#tbl_regression(demand_model, intercept=T)\n\nModel Interpretation:\n\nIn terms of overall model fit, we see that the F-statistic of 168.7384997 is significantly different from zero meaning that the model fits well. The R-squared value is 0.9388 meaning that we are explaining 93.88 percent of the variance of quantity. Given the variance we saw in the plot, it is not surprising that the R-squared is not terribly high.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -12.9899384 and a p-value of 5.1295431^{-8} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated demand curve for the durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{Q = 25.0494315 -0.7873875 P} \\] where wtp serves as a proxy for price. In simple terms, this demand curve suggests that for every $1.00 increase in the price of the durable good, the quantity demanded in the sample of respondents decreases by 0.7874 units of the product.\nVisually and empirically we can see that the relationship is linear, meaning that it has the form \\(\\mathsf{y = mx + b}\\) or, more commonly analytics, \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 \\ x}\\). Not all data exhibit this clear linear relationship and we will address how to estimate nonlinear relationships later.\n\nFor a visual representation of the demand data and the estimated demand curve, refer to Figure 6.2. Based on the estimated coefficients and the robust goodness-of-fit statistics, we have confidence that the demand curve accurately represents the behavior of consumers. By sampling actual customers and asking relevant questions about their willingness to pay for this durable good, we have obtained a reliable estimate of the demand curve, which serves as a crucial element in constructing the profit function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Demand data and estimated demand curve.",

    "text": "4.11 Conclusion\nIn the world of evidence-based entrepreneurship, we don’t rely on guesswork; we use judgment rooted in evidence to guide our decisions and actions. This shift from guesswork to informed judgment involves crafting hypotheses and testing them through experiments. Ultimately, all these tests revolve around a fundamental question: Is our innovation viable?\nThe litmus test for viability lies in customer validation. If customers confirm that they have a problem and believe our solution can solve it, they’re more likely to buy. This is the essence of demand. Moreover, not all customers are created equal. Some may prefer our solution more than others, leading to variations in demand. Additionally, the channel through which we sell our product or service can significantly impact demand.\nWhile traditional business model validation tests may not explicitly estimate the demand curve, they help us understand if the demand curve exists, and if so, its strength.\nOne of the most robust ways to gauge the viability of an innovation is by calculating its expected profitability using evidence gathered from customers. In the early stages of testing, we focus on validation tests to ascertain if any demand for the solution exists. As we progress and the solution evolves, we transition to calculating expected profits, leveraging the evidence at hand. Customer demand serves as the cornerstone of profitability calculations. Once we accurately estimate the demand curve, it becomes our compass for navigating the intricacies of revenue, cost, and ultimately, profitability.\nIn seeking evidence for the key decisions in a startup, demand isn’t just a concept; it’s the catalyst that enables us to predict the decisions that lead to success.",

    "text": "5.1 Why Study Demand?\nSuccessful innovations hinge on being desirable, feasible, and viable. These aspects are interdependent. If an innovation lacks desirability, feasibility alone can’t save it. If it’s not feasible, it can’t meet the desired level of performance. Without desirability and feasibility, viability is unattainable because it can’t sustainably fulfill customer needs. This interplay among desirability, feasibility, and viability defines entrepreneurship as an economic activity, where success is measured by value creation and long-term profitability.\nValue isn’t limited to financial profit; it can encompass outcomes like health, dignity, comfort, or spirituality, particularly in ventures with non-profit missions. Even when value isn’t financial, it’s often referred to as profit for measurement purposes, and profitability is a key success metric.\nProfit is typically calculated as revenue minus cost, expressed as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathsf{\\pi} &= \\mathsf{Revenue - Cost} \\\\        \n     &= \\mathsf{R - C} \\\\        \n     &= \\mathsf{PQ - cQ -F}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathsf{\\pi}\\) represents profit, \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) is revenue, \\(\\mathsf{C}\\) is cost, \\(\\mathsf{P}\\) is price, \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) is quantity, \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is variable cost, and \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) is fixed cost. To achieve viability, a venture must consistently generate positive profit. Notably, the quantity variable \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) represents demand for the solution at the price \\(\\mathsf{P}\\). Demand is a foundational factor in assessing expected profitability.\nThe surest route to entrepreneurial success is identifying customers with a genuine need and addressing it with a solution. Regardless of the innovation’s technical superiority or other accolades, without customer demand, it won’t succeed commercially. “Better” must be defined in terms of solving customer problems.\nFrom an economic perspective, discovering customer problems equates to finding demand curves. When customers have a problem they want solved, they will “demand” your solution. Conversely, if there’s no demand, even the most remarkable solution will fail commercially. Finding your customers’ demand curve for your solution and analyzing price and revenue potential based on it is crucial.\nIn established companies, profit components are derived from accounting data. However, in startups, evidence-based decisions require calculating expected profit using demand. In this chapter, we’ll delve into demand curves, their properties, and, most importantly, how to collect customer preference data to identify the demand curve. Armed with this knowledge, we can construct revenue, cost, and profit curves to assess the long-term viability of the venture.",

    "section": "5.2 Demand Curves",
    "text": "5.2 Demand Curves\nA demand curve is a critical concept in understanding customer behavior and revenue generation. It represents the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity customers are willing to buy. Let’s break it down further:\n\nDemand Curve Definition: A demand curve is essentially a graph or mathematical equation that shows how much customers value a product at different prices. In its simplest form, it can be expressed as \\(\\mathsf{Q = a - bP}\\), where \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) is the quantity, and \\(\\mathsf{P}\\) is the price. For example, Figure 5.1 shows this demand curve graphically. The intercept is 2000 units meaning that 2000 units will be sold when price is $0. For every dollar increase in price, demand falls by 2 units. This demand curve implies that at a price of $750, customers will buy 500 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Demand Curve: Q = 2000 - 2P\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Demand: The law of demand states that as the price of a product rises, customers tend to buy less of it, and as the price falls, they buy more. This aligns with common shopping behavior: when something becomes more expensive, we often seek alternatives.\nFactors Influencing Demand: While price is a significant factor, demand curves can be influenced by other variables like income, advertising, and the prices of other goods. A complete demand curve takes these factors into account through a more complex equation, such as \\[\\mathsf{Q_x(P_x) = a - bP_x + cP_y + dM + \\ldots}\\]where \\(\\mathsf{P_x}\\) is the price of the product in question, \\(\\mathsf{P_y}\\) is the price of another good, and \\(\\mathsf{M}\\) is income.\nChanges in Demand vs. Quantity Demanded: When factors other than the price of the product change, the entire demand curve shifts. As Figure 5.2 illustrates, this movement from point A to C is known as a change in demand. Conversely, a change in quantity demanded occurs when only the price of the product changes, causing movement along the demand curve from point A to B. For example, an increase in income might lead to a higher demand for a product, shifting the demand. This distinction is important when we work with demand curves with more variables than just price. As you may intuit from the graph, the effect of non-price variables is to change the intercept of the demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Change in Demand vs. Change in Quantity Demanded\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand curves are powerful tools for understanding customer behavior and making informed business decisions. They help businesses set appropriate prices, predict customer responses to price changes, and identify the impact of various external factors on product demand.",

    "text": "5.3 Price Sensitivity\nIn traditional economics, much emphasis is placed on the concept of price elasticity, which measures how sensitive customers are to changes in prices. Price-sensitive customers are always on the lookout for discounts and quickly reduce their purchases when prices rise slightly. For well-established companies with ample transaction data and small, infrequent price changes, studying price sensitivity through elasticity makes sense—it helps optimize profit.\nHowever, in the entrepreneurial context, where we often lack transaction data and need to directly engage with customers to estimate demand curves across a wide price range, a different approach is more practical. Rather than analyzing price sensitivity indirectly through elasticity, we will focus on how to directly find and estimate demand curves. This approach allows us to analyze everything we need without the need for elasticity calculations.\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into elasticity, you can explore the appendix in ?sec-elasticity.",

    "section": "5.4 Where do we get demand curves?",
    "text": "5.4 Where do we get demand curves?\nIn the realm of economics, demand curves play a pivotal role in understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics. These curves provide insights into how consumers respond to changes in prices and other variables, guiding businesses in their decision-making processes. However, acquiring accurate demand curves has often been regarded as a complex task, typically requiring the expertise of economists and statisticians with advanced degrees. Large corporations usually have the resources to employ such experts, enabling them to make informed strategic choices based on well-defined demand curves.\nYet, the landscape is different for most businesses, especially entrepreneurial startups. These ventures often lack the luxury of dedicated economists and statisticians, making them vulnerable to competitive pressures resulting from less-informed decisions. Traditionally, in economics education, students are cautioned about the challenges of statistically determining demand curves. These curves can be elusive due to various factors, including the complex interplay between supply and demand, historical data biases, and endogeneity. As a result, economics textbooks and courses typically provide demand curves as given, and students are not encouraged to delve into the intricate process of estimating them.\nThe good news, however, is that startups can sidestep the complexities traditionally associated with estimating demand curves. In the modern business landscape, many entrepreneurs are already collecting data as part of their efforts to validate their business models. This process, often referred to as customer development, revolves around confirming whether customers indeed face the problems that a solution aims to address and whether they genuinely desire that solution. If customers do not resonate with the problem-solution fit, entrepreneurs will likely encounter limited demand and customers who are highly price-sensitive.\nSo, how can startups navigate the demand curve challenge without the need for specialized economists? The answer lies in understanding the concept of “willingness to pay.” Think of a demand curve as a lineup of your customers, standing shoulder to shoulder, ranked in descending order of their willingness to pay – the maximum amount a customer would be willing to pay for a unit of your solution. In essence, willingness to pay is equivalent to a price point.\nBy harnessing your knowledge of customers’ willingness to pay, you already possess the fundamental elements necessary to estimate a demand curve. This process is more straightforward and less prone to the statistical complexities associated with traditional demand curve estimation. It primarily involves three steps:\n\nCollect willingness to pay Data: Gather data on customers’ willingness to pay, effectively using it as a proxy for price.\nUse willingness to pay Data for Quantity Calculation: Utilize the willingness to pay data to calculate the corresponding quantities customers are willing to purchase at various price points.\nEstimate the Demand Curve: Apply regression analysis to the price-quantity data, allowing you to construct an accurate demand curve. In the subsequent sections, we will delve into these steps in greater detail, exploring how to obtain the data and transform it into valuable insights for your startup.\n\n\nCollect Willingness to Pay Data\nGaining insights into your customers’ willingness to pay is crucial for understanding demand. To collect this data effectively, follow these steps:\n\nDescribe the Solution: Begin by providing a comprehensive description of your product or service. Ensure respondents understand your solution as if they were making a purchase. Even in the early stages, offer the best and most recent description possible.\nAsk Customers Their Willingness to Pay: After describing the solution, convey your commitment to addressing your customers’ problems and improving their lives through your solution. Ask them, “What is the most you would be willing to pay for this solution?” Record their responses, preferably in a spreadsheet.\n\nKeep in mind that respondents may provide flawed estimates as they may not fully consider all factors involved in an actual transaction. Some may overestimate their willingness to pay during a survey, while others may underestimate it. However, willingness to pay data still provides remarkably accurate insights into demand.\n\nAvoid softening the question by naming a specific price and asking if they would buy at that price, as this limits the richness of the data you can gather. Remember that asking this question is not impolite when you genuinely offer a solution to a real problem. Non-customers’ responses, which tend to be biased, should be avoided as they may lead to incorrect validation or rejection of your idea.\n\n\nMinimize Sampling Bias: Gather data primarily from your target customers to avoid non-relevant responses that can distort your findings.\nSample Enough Customers: While a larger sample size is generally better, focus more on refining your understanding of the questions and sampling the right customers. Small, inexpensive samples (30–50 responses) are suitable for refining your understanding, but larger, more expensive samples are needed when seeking a representative demand curve.\n\n\nCollect Customer Characteristic Data: Over time, your understanding of your customers will evolve. To aid this process, request basic demographic information, such as age, gender, income level, education, job category, and geography. As you refine your hypotheses, add new questions about customer characteristics to narrow your focus to real customers while minimizing bias in your sampling.\n\nBy gathering willingness to pay data and continually refining your understanding of your customers, you can better identify your target audience and tailor your efforts to serve them effectively.\n\n\nUse Willingness to Pay Data to Calculate Quantity\nAs established in Section 5.2, a demand curve essentially illustrates the relationship between price and the quantity that consumers are willing to consume at that price. Willingness to pay data provides a proxy for price but where do we get the quantity variable? Let’s look first at the class of products known as durable goods which, as the name implies, are items that endure over time and are not fully consumed in their initial use, such as cars, personal computers, or houses.\nTypically, consumers do not purchase more than one unit of a durable good within a short time frame because these products provide sustained value. Consequently, when dealing with durable goods, the quantity of consumers willing to buy is often synonymous with the quantity of the product sold at a given price. In simpler terms, you can count the number of consumers willing to buy at a specific price, and that number represents the quantity demanded at that price.\nLet’s consider a sample of willingness to pay data to illustrate this concept. Willingness to pay responses for 27 respondents are given in Table 5.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrespondent\nwtp\n\n\n\n\n1\n15.00\n\n\n2\n5.00\n\n\n3\n20.00\n\n\n4\n15.00\n\n\n5\n12.00\n\n\n6\n0.00\n\n\n7\n10.00\n\n\n8\n35.00\n\n\n9\n17.00\n\n\n10\n0.00\n\n\n11\n20.00\n\n\n12\n0.00\n\n\n13\n22.99\n\n\n14\n25.00\n\n\n15\n15.00\n\n\n16\n0.00\n\n\n17\n10.00\n\n\n18\n15.00\n\n\n19\n0.00\n\n\n20\n0.00\n\n\n21\n20.00\n\n\n22\n3.00\n\n\n23\n15.00\n\n\n24\n30.00\n\n\n25\n15.00\n\n\n26\n20.00\n\n\n27\n23.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Willingness to pay for each of 27 respondents.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, you can observe that two respondents were willing to pay $30 or more for the product, and six out of 27 respondents indicated they would not pay anything, which raises concerns about non-target customers.\nThe first step in converting this willingness to pay data into quantity data is to count how frequently the unique values of willingness to pay were named. In our example, there are 13 unique values of willingness to pay named by the 27 respondents. The unique values and the count of how frequently they were named are given in Table 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtp\ncount\n\n\n\n\n0.00\n6\n\n\n3.00\n1\n\n\n5.00\n1\n\n\n10.00\n2\n\n\n12.00\n1\n\n\n15.00\n6\n\n\n17.00\n1\n\n\n20.00\n4\n\n\n22.99\n1\n\n\n23.00\n1\n\n\n25.00\n1\n\n\n30.00\n1\n\n\n35.00\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Unique values of willingness to pay for the product named by the respondents and a count of how frequently each willingness to pay value was named.\n\n\n\n\nCount is similar to quantity but will not really serve as a measure of quantity because it neglects the impact of the law of demand. If you were to accept count as your quantity variable, your demand curve would imply that six units are consumed at a price of $15.00 but only one unit is consumed at a price of $12. The law of demand requires that quantity increase as price falls so count violates that law. We can restate the law of demand to say that anyone who would buy at a higher price would also buy at a lower price. This means that the respondent who is willing to pay $35 is also willing to pay $30 and should be included in the quantity data for $30; the respondent who is willing to pay \\$30 and the respondent who is willing to pay \\$35 are both also willing to pay \\$25 and should be included in the quantity data for \\$25; and so on.\nTo calculate the quantity, start with the highest willingness to pay respondent and use that count as quantity. For the next highest willingness to pay value, add the count of that price to the quantity of the higher willingness to pay respondent. Continue accumulating these values through the lowest willingness to pay value.This cumulative sum approach ensures that the quantity at a lower price includes respondents who are also willing to buy at higher prices, adhering to the law of demand. The resulting price-quantity data can be used to estimate the demand curve for the durable good. The quantity and count variables are shown together with the willingness to pay variable in Table Table 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtp\ncount\nquantity\n\n\n\n\n35.00\n1\n1\n\n\n30.00\n1\n2\n\n\n25.00\n1\n3\n\n\n23.00\n1\n4\n\n\n22.99\n1\n5\n\n\n20.00\n4\n9\n\n\n17.00\n1\n10\n\n\n15.00\n6\n16\n\n\n12.00\n1\n17\n\n\n10.00\n2\n19\n\n\n5.00\n1\n20\n\n\n3.00\n1\n21\n\n\n0.00\n6\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: Willingness to pay, count, and quantity data for demand estimation.\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, here’s a step-by-step approach to obtain quantity data from willingness to pay data:\n\nSort the willingness to pay data in ascending order.\nCount the number of respondents willing to pay at each unique price point.\nCalculate the quantity demanded at each price by cumulatively summing the count data.\n\n\n\nEstimate the Demand Curve\nIn the process of constructing a function of the expected profit to be earned by an innovation, we need the demand curve as the first building block. The demand curve is an equation that shows the quantity demanded at every price. We have data from representative consumers showing prices and the quantities that will be demanded at those prices. We need to convert those data into an equation, and to do that, we will use linear regression.\nThere are literally dozens of choices of software that will estimate the demand curve equation from price-quantity data. This book gives a detailed explanation of the process using three common analytics platforms: spreadsheet, R, and Python. Depending on your skills and preferences, choose your preferred platform and learn the details about using that platform for estimating the demand curve through regression. In this chapter, we will remain neutral about the estimation platform and invite it to you to explore the particulars of your preferred platform in the supplementary documents dedicated to your platform. For example, throughout this book on entrepreneurship analytics, we will study the expected profitability of Muscle Cola, a hypothetical protein infused soft drink that provides protein replenishment and refreshment after a workout.\nAt this stage, we will just report the demand estimation of the data collected and reported above and consider how to interpret the regression results as the demand equation. While regression results are reported differently by different analytics platforms, they all have the same components: the regression estimates of the variable coefficients, standard errors of the estimated coefficients, t-statistics for the estimated coefficients, and a variety of measures of the goodness of the statistical fit.\nLet’s dig into the regression results for the quantity demanded of a durable good as a function of price. The data for this regression model were presented in Table 5.3. There, willingness to pay (wtp) serves as a proxy for the independent, predictor variable of price. Changes in the dependent variable quantity are caused by changes in price. We use linear regression as a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. In a linear relationship, one variable changes at a constant rate relative to another \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 x}\\). This relationship can be visualized through a straight line when the data is plotted on a graph, hence the term “linear.”\nLet’s start our analysis of the demand curve by visualizing of the relationship between our dependent variable quantity and our independent variable wtp in a scatterplot. This scatterplot is shown in Figure 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Scatterplot of the relationship between price and quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, the relationship looks linear and the impact of wtp on quantity seems clear and strongly negative as we would expect.\n\nUse Linear Regression Analysis\nUsing regression, we can get the specific linear equation of the relationship between price and quantity sold.  Linear regression is employed to fit linear models to datasets, enabling the analysis of the relationship between two or more variables by choosing coefficients that minimize the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.\nModel Interpretation: The summary of the linear model gives details about the coefficients of the equation, error estimates, and other statistical measures. Interpreting the summary of a linear regression model involves evaluating various statistical metrics to understand the model’s performance and validity. Here are the key components:\n\nEstimate: These are the estimated coefficients of the model. In the context of a simple linear regression model \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1\\ x_1}\\), \\(\\mathsf{b_0}\\) is the y-intercept (the value of \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) when \\(\\mathsf{x = 0}\\)), and \\(\\mathsf{b_1}\\) is the slope, indicating the change in \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) for a one-unit change in \\(\\mathsf{x}\\).\nStd. Error: This measures the variability in the estimate for the coefficient. Lower values indicate more reliable estimates.\nt value: It’s the coefficient divided by its standard error. It tests the hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero (no effect). A t-value of 2 would indicate that the coefficient is two standard errors away from 0.\nPr(&gt;|t|) or p-value: A low p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero.\n\nIn other words, a low p-value gives you confidence that the relationship between \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) is not just random correlation.\n\nIn fact, the p-value can be interpreted as the level of confidence you can have: p = 0.05 means that there is only a five percent chance that the relationship is actually random rather than a meaningful relationship where \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) is influencing \\(\\mathsf{y}\\).\n\nWe typically say that we have 95 percent confidence about the estimate in this case.\nTechnically, this means that if we repeated the data collection and estimation 100 times, we would expect that in five of the 100 cases our estimate would actually be zero rather than the estimated coefficient.\n\n\nIn addition to examining individual coefficients, understanding the overall fit of a linear regression model is crucial. The summary of a linear regression model provides essential statistics to assess the model’s performance and validity. Here are key components related to the overall model fit:\n\nR-squared: R-squared is a measure of how well the independent variables explain the variability in the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.\n\nAn R-squared value of 0.0 indicates that the model explains none of the variance, while an R-squared of 1.0 means that the model explains all of the variance.\nFor example, if R-squared is 0.80, it suggests that 80% of the variance in the dependent variable can be attributed to the independent variables included in the model.\nR-squared is often interpreted as the goodness of fit, where higher values indicate a better fit.\n\nF-statistic: The F-statistic assesses the overall significance of the regression model. It tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients in the model are equal to zero, meaning that the independent variables have no effect on the dependent variable.\n\nA high F-statistic indicates that the model as a whole is statistically significant, meaning that at least one of the independent variables is contributing significantly to explaining the variance in the dependent variable.\nThe F-statistic is associated with a p-value (typically ≤ 0.05), and a low p-value suggests that the model is statistically significant.\nIf the F-statistic is significant, it implies that the regression equation, as a whole, provides meaningful information about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n\n\nIn summary, R-squared provides insight into how well the independent variables collectively explain the variation in the dependent variable. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit. The F-statistic and its associated p-value evaluate whether the model, as a whole, is statistically significant. If the p-value is low, it suggests that the model is meaningful and provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variables.\n\n\nEstimating Demand for the Willingness to Pay Data\nConsider the output from the regression of our transformed data on quantity and price, using the lm function from R.\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = quantity ~ wtp, data = wtp_q_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.9395 -1.6873 -0.3017  1.8244  3.5091 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept) 25.04943    1.18871   21.07 3.05e-10 ***\nwtp         -0.78739    0.06062  -12.99 5.13e-08 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 2.222 on 11 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.9388,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.9332 \nF-statistic: 168.7 on 1 and 11 DF,  p-value: 5.13e-08\n\n\n\n#install.packages(\"gtsummary\")\n#library(gtsummary)\n#tbl_regression(demand_model, intercept=T)\n\nModel Interpretation:\n\nIn terms of overall model fit, we see that the F-statistic of 168.7384997 is significantly different from zero meaning that the model fits well. The R-squared value is 0.9388 meaning that we are explaining 93.88 percent of the variance of quantity. Given the variance we saw in the plot, it is not surprising that the R-squared is not terribly high.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -12.9899384 and a p-value of 5.1295431^{-8} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated demand curve for the durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{Q = 25.0494315 -0.7873875 P} \\] where wtp serves as a proxy for price. In simple terms, this demand curve suggests that for every $1.00 increase in the price of the durable good, the quantity demanded in the sample of respondents decreases by 0.7874 units of the product.\nVisually and empirically we can see that the relationship is linear, meaning that it has the form \\(\\mathsf{y = mx + b}\\) or, more commonly analytics, \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 \\ x}\\). Not all data exhibit this clear linear relationship and we will address how to estimate nonlinear relationships later.\n\nFor a visual representation of the demand data and the estimated demand curve, refer to Figure 6.2. Based on the estimated coefficients and the robust goodness-of-fit statistics, we have confidence that the demand curve accurately represents the behavior of consumers. By sampling actual customers and asking relevant questions about their willingness to pay for this durable good, we have obtained a reliable estimate of the demand curve, which serves as a crucial element in constructing the profit function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Demand data and estimated demand curve.",

This shift from guesswork to informed judgment involves crafting hypotheses and testing them through experiments. Ultimately, all these tests revolve around a fundamental question: Is our innovation viable?\nThe litmus test for viability lies in customer validation. If customers confirm that they have a problem and believe our solution can solve it, they’re more likely to buy. This is the essence of demand. Moreover, not all customers are created equal. Some may prefer our solution more than others, leading to variations in demand. Additionally, the channel through which we sell our product or service can significantly impact demand.\nWhile traditional business model validation tests may not explicitly estimate the demand curve, they help us understand if the demand curve exists, and if so, its strength.\nOne of the most robust ways to gauge the viability of an innovation is by calculating its expected profitability using evidence gathered from customers. In the early stages of testing, we focus on validation tests to ascertain if any demand for the solution exists. As we progress and the solution evolves, we transition to calculating expected profits, leveraging the evidence at hand. Customer demand serves as the cornerstone of profitability calculations. Once we accurately estimate the demand curve, it becomes our compass for navigating the intricacies of revenue, cost, and ultimately, profitability.\nIn seeking evidence for the key decisions in a startup, demand isn’t just a concept; it’s the catalyst that enables us to predict the decisions that lead to success.",

    "text": "6.2 Gather Willingness to Pay Data\nUnderstanding the demand for durable goods requires a strategic approach to data collection. Due to the lasting nature of these goods, gauging customers’ willingness to pay becomes paramount. While the general principles of data collection remain constant, there are nuanced methods tailored to durable goods.\n\nContextual Introduction: Begin by setting the stage. Describe the product in detail, emphasizing its long-term benefits, durability, and how it stands apart from other similar products in the market. A well-painted picture helps potential customers visualize the product in their lives.\nSeek Genuine Feedback: Before diving into the monetary aspect, engage customers in a dialogue about the product.\n\nThe Wow Factor Test: Start by asking them to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 10. Don’t give them any conditions on what 1 or 10 means – that would only bias their responses. This initial interaction can serve as an icebreaker and provide invaluable feedback.\nOpen-Ended Queries: Encourage them to share what they like the most and least about the product. While many might skip these open-ended questions, it sends a clear message that you value their opinion.\nProduct Improvement: Ask for suggestions on how the product can be enhanced. Not only does this give you a perspective on areas of improvement, but it also makes the customer feel valued and engaged.\n\nPositioning the Willingness to Pay Question: Now that you’ve engaged the customer and cultivated a mindset of evaluation, you can segue into the pivotal question without it sounding opportunistic.\n\nSet the Tone: Preface the question by expressing genuine interest in their opinion. Mention that as entrepreneurs or students, you’re passionate about the product and genuinely need their help in shaping it further.\nThe Main Query: Then, frame the question: “Considering the features and benefits we’ve discussed, what is the most you would be willing to pay for this product?” By this point, the customer perceives this question as another form of rating the product, rather than feeling pressured into a commitment.\n\nData Documentation: Record their willingness to pay responses systematically, noting any additional feedback or comments that might accompany the figures. Over time, this will allow you to discern patterns and trends in consumer sentiment.\nAcknowledge and Appreciate: Thank your respondents for their time and insights. Let them know their feedback is instrumental in the evolution of the product.\n\nIn conclusion, for durable goods, gauging willingness to pay isn’t just about fetching a figure. It’s a blend of understanding perceptions, capturing genuine feedback, and making potential customers feel valued in the product’s journey. Approached with care and genuine interest, it becomes less about money and more about mutual value creation.\nAs an example, we have a relatively short survey of respondents who are representative of the target customers for an innovative product. The respondents were shown the product, engaged in a wow focus test, and then asked about the most they would be willing to pay for the durable good. The data set is named durable_good_data and has a variable named wow with the wow factor score awarded by each respondent (“Rate this product on a scale of 1 - 10”) and their willingness to pay.\nThe data are found in Table 6.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwow\nwtp\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.00\n\n\n8\n1.99\n\n\n8\n2.00\n\n\n6\n1.96\n\n\n10\n3.00\n\n\n1\n0.00\n\n\n3\n0.51\n\n\n10\n2.97\n\n\n10\n3.00\n\n\n6\n1.45\n\n\n8\n1.96\n\n\n3\n1.00\n\n\n1\n0.00\n\n\n10\n2.49\n\n\n1\n0.00\n\n\n10\n7.13\n\n\n10\n5.00\n\n\n5\n0.92\n\n\n10\n3.94\n\n\n6\n1.51\n\n\n10\n3.01\n\n\n9\n2.51\n\n\n10\n3.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Wow factor scores and willingness to pay data from a survey of 23 target customers.",

    "text": "6.3 Calculating Quantity for Durable Goods from Willingness to Pay Data\nTo derive a demand curve from willingness to pay data for durable goods, we need to convert the data into a price-quantity relationship that aligns with the law of demand. Here’s a condensed step-by-step process:\n\nOrganize the Data: Arrange willingness to pay data and identify unique values.\nCount Responses: Quantify how many respondents are willing to pay at each unique price point.\nCalculate Cumulative Quantity: To adhere to the law of demand, ensure that a respondent willing to pay a higher price would also buy at a lower price. Starting from the highest price, accumulate the counts to reflect the total number of consumers willing to purchase at or below each price.\n\nLet’s work through the process of calculating quantity from the willingness to pay data in the durable_good_data tibble. We begin by getting a count of how many times each unique willingness to pay was named. The R codebase and output for this count are\n\n\nCode\ndurable_count &lt;- durable_good_data |&gt;\n  group_by(wtp) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n())\ndurable_count\n\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 2\n     wtp count\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1  0        4\n 2  0.51     1\n 3  0.92     1\n 4  1        1\n 5  1.45     1\n 6  1.51     1\n 7  1.96     2\n 8  1.99     1\n 9  2        1\n10  2.49     1\n11  2.51     1\n12  2.97     1\n13  3        2\n14  3.01     1\n15  3.41     1\n16  3.94     1\n17  5        1\n18  7.13     1\n\n\nNext we convert the count variable into a quantity variable that adheres to the law of demand by calculating a cumulative sum of the counts beginning with the highest willingness to pay. The R code and output of the calculation of quantity as a cumulative sum of count gives us:\n\n\nCode\ndurable_quantity &lt;- durable_count |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(wtp)) |&gt; \n  mutate(quantity = cumsum(count))\ndurable_quantity\n\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 3\n     wtp count quantity\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1  7.13     1        1\n 2  5        1        2\n 3  3.94     1        3\n 4  3.41     1        4\n 5  3.01     1        5\n 6  3        2        7\n 7  2.97     1        8\n 8  2.51     1        9\n 9  2.49     1       10\n10  2        1       11\n11  1.99     1       12\n12  1.96     2       14\n13  1.51     1       15\n14  1.45     1       16\n15  1        1       17\n16  0.92     1       18\n17  0.51     1       19\n18  0        4       23\n\n\n\nThis is more efficient to do in a single command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompting your AI for code to calculate quantity\n\n\n\nThe code we need to transform the willingness to pay variable into a quantity variable is not very intuitive for ChatGPT to understand. To get accurate and reliable code, it’s essential to be very specific with the prompt, especially when using advanced transformations. Please use the following template to ensure accuracy:\n\n“Here’s a glimpse of my data: glimpse(tb)” (Replace tb with your data frame’s name and paste the output from your R console showing the structure of your data).\nI’m looking to use tidyverse to transform my willingness to pay (wtp) data into a quantity variable.

    "text": "6.4 Estimate the Demand Curve\nArmed with the willingness to pay wtp and quantity, we are ready to estimate the demand curve for the durable good. The data are stored in a tibble named durable_quantity and the glimpse of the data is\n\n\nRows: 18\nColumns: 3\n$ wtp      &lt;dbl&gt; 7.13, 5.00, 3.94, 3.41, 3.01, 3.00, 2.97, 2.51, 2.49, 2.00, 1…\n$ count    &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4\n$ quantity &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23\n\n\nHere, wtp is willingness to pay which serves as a proxy for price and quantity is the dependent variable that is caused by changes in price.\nBefore regression of the price / quantity relationship, let’s visualize it in a scatterplot using ggplot.\n\n\nCode\n# Plotting the data\nggplot(data = durable_quantity, \n       aes(x=wtp, y=quantity)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x=\"Price\", y=\"Quantity\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Scatterplot visualization of the relatiionship between quantity and willingness to pay (price) data.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, the impact of wtp on quantity seems clear and strongly negative as we would expect. The shape of the relationship may be linear but there are strong hints of a nonlinear relationship. We will test that.\n\nEstimating the Linear Demand Curve\nFirst, let’s use the linear model function lm() from R to estimate the linear regression model of quantity and wtp assuming a linear relationship between the variables.\n\n\nCode\nlinear_demand_model &lt;- lm(data = durable_quantity, \n                       quantity ~ wtp)\nsummary(linear_demand_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = quantity ~ wtp, data = durable_quantity)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.9700 -1.6468 -0.2875  1.3799  6.3226 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The R-squared value is 0.8414 meaning that we are explaining 84.14 percent of the variance of quantity.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -9.2131961 and a p-value of 8.4833343^{-8} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated linear demand curve for the durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{Q = 19.4119 -3.4691 P} \\] where wtp serves as a proxy for price. In simple terms, this demand curve suggests that for every $1.00 increase in the price of the durable good, the quantity demanded across the sample of respondents decreases by 3.4691 units of the product.\nEmpirically we can see that there is a good fit of the linear model to the price / quantity data. Visualization throug a scatterplot suggests that we should consider a nonlinear relationship such as a negative exponential demand curve.\n\n\n\n\nEstimating the Exponential Demand Curve\nThe negative exponential demand curve has the form \\[\\mathsf{Q = a \\mbox{e}^{bP}}\\] where e is the base for the exponential function exp(). We cannot estimate this nonlinear relationship directly because all linear regression must have the form \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 x}\\) and the negative exponential relationship does not have this linear form.\n\nFortunately, we can transform the data to “linearize” it giving us a linear relationship. To linearize the data, we take the natural log (log() in R) of both sides of the demand curve giving us \\[\\mathsf{log(Q) =  \\alpha + b P}\\] where \\(\\mathsf{\\alpha = log(a)}\\). In words, we simply need to take the log of the dependent variable (y-variable) quantity and estimate the linear regression. The R code to do this and the output are\n\n\nCode\nexponential_demand_model &lt;- lm(log(quantity) ~ wtp, durable_quantity)\nsummary(exponential_demand_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(quantity) ~ wtp, data = durable_quantity)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.30389 -0.17734  0.05967  0.13747  0.26068 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Looking at the regression results, we must first recognize that we have the regression model of \\(\\mathsf{log(quantity)}\\) rather than the model of \\(\\mathsf{quantity}\\).\nIn terms of overall fit of the exponential model, we see that the F-statistic of 336.9507 is significantly different from zero meaning that the model fits well. The R-squared value is 0.9547 meaning that we are explaining 95.47 percent of the variance of quantity. The F-statistic and the R-squared values for the exponential model are both greater than their counterparts in the linear model. This suggests that the relationship is more likely to be exponential than linear.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -18.3562173 and a p-value of 3.5750384^{-12} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated linear demand curve for the durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{log(Q) = 3.3444 -0.4929 P} \\] or \\[ \\mathsf{Q = e^{3.3444 -0.4929 P}}\\] where wtp serves as a proxy for price.\nBecause it is an exponential demand curve, the interpretation is different. For every $1.00 increase in the price of the durable good, the logarithm of the quantity demanded across the sample of respondents decreases by 0.4929 units of the product. The change in logarithm of a value is not very intuitive to most of us.\n\n\n\nTest to Choose between the Linear Demand and Exponential Demand Models\nThe linear model and the exponential model are not directly comparable because one is the linear model of \\(\\mathsf{quantity}\\) and the other is the linear model of \\(\\mathsf{log(quantity)}\\). In general, comparing the F-statistics and the R-squared values of the two models gives us a pretty clear picture of which model is better for the data. However, it is not the best comparison.\nThe “Akaike Information Criterion” (AIC) is a single number that encapsulates the quality of each model in its entirety. It takes into consideration how well the model fits the data (like R-squared) and the simplicity of the model (we prefer simpler models because they’re easier to understand and less prone to errors). The model with the lowest AIC is often considered the best choice, as it represents the best balance between fitting our data well and being straightforward.\nLet’s compare the linear demand model with the exponential demand model based on their AIC scores.\n\n\nCode\n# Compare the AIC values for the two models\n(aic_linear &lt;- AIC(linear_demand_model))\n\n\n[1] 89.90966\n\n\nCode\n(aic_exponential &lt;- AIC(exponential_demand_model))\n\n\n[1] -5.157227\n\n\nThe AIC score for the linear demand model is 89.9096587 and the AIC score for the exponential demand model is -5.1572273. Since the AIC score of the exponential demand model is much lower than from the linear demand model, we conclude that the demand curve is indeed exponential and choose that regression model results.",

    "text": "7.1 Non-durable Goods\nIn the world of entrepreneurial analytics, understanding customer demand is a pivotal factor. In the previous chapter, we explored the intricacies of durable goods. Now, let’s dive into non-durable goods, another commonly-encountered dimension of demand analysis in startups.\nNon-durable goods are products that are typically consumed in a single use, such as food, toiletries, or movie tickets. These items are characterized by their transient nature and limited lifespan. Unlike durable goods that last for an extended period, non-durable goods are usually exhausted after one use. As a result, we normally expect that consumers will purchase more than one unit per period.\nIt is important to treat non-durable goods correctly because treating them like durable goods and asking only about consumer’s willingness to pay overlooks the multiple units that each consumer intends to purchase.\nExamples of Non-durable Goods:\nTo effectively analyze non-durable goods demand, it’s crucial to gather both price and quantity data. Unlike durable goods, where consumers typically buy one unit for an extended period, non-durable goods often involve repeat purchases within a given time frame. Therefore, understanding how price influences the quantity that individual consumers intend to purchase is essential for informed decision-making in entrepreneurial ventures.\nThe primary approach to collect price-quantity data for non-durable goods is to ask potential customers how many they will purchase at a series of prices, .e.g., $10, $20, etc. You name the price and they name the quantity giving us the price-quantity we need to estimate their demand model. The major drawback is that you will be asking many similar questions. If you ask too many, your respondents will suffer survey fatigue and stop answering.",

    "text": "7.2 Quantity Data at Various Prices\n\nGathering Price-Quantity Data\nCollecting data about how many units potential customers would purchase at various prices is a vital step in understanding demand for non-durable goods. However, the way you approach and interact with potential customers during this data collection process can significantly impact the quality of insights you gather.\nHere are some essential tips for effectively interacting with potential customers:\n\nSet the Context: Begin your conversation by providing context about the non-durable good. Explain its unique features, benefits, and how it addresses specific needs or problems. Help potential customers visualize how the product fits into their lives.\nEngage in a Dialogue: Before jumping into questions about pricing, engage customers in a conversation about the product.\n\nThe Wow Factor Test: Start by asking them to rate their initial impression of the product on a scale of 1 to 10, without predefined meanings for 1 or 10. This not only breaks the ice but also provides valuable feedback.\nOpen-Ended Queries: Encourage customers to share what they like the most and least about the product. These open-ended questions can uncover insights you might have missed.\nSeek Suggestions: Ask for suggestions on how the product could better meet their needs. This not only provides improvement ideas but also makes customers feel valued and engaged in the product’s development.\n\nIntroduce the Pricing Question Thoughtfully: When transitioning to the question about how many units they would purchase at different prices, do so thoughtfully.\n\nExpress Genuine Interest: Preface the pricing question by expressing genuine interest in their opinions. Explain that you’re passionate about the product’s potential and sincerely value their input.\nFrame the Question: Phrase the pricing question as an extension of their evaluation: “Given the product’s features and benefits we’ve discussed, at a price of $3, how many units would you buy?” “At a price of $3.50, how many units would you buy?” and so on. This framing makes it feel like another aspect of rating the product rather than a commitment.\n\nSystematic Data Recording: Ensure that you systematically record the responses to willingness-to-pay questions, along with any additional feedback or comments provided by customers. This documentation will help you identify trends and patterns in consumer sentiment over time.\nShow Appreciation: Always express gratitude for their time and insights. Let customers know that their feedback plays a vital role in shaping the product and its journey.\n\nIn summary, gathering data about how customers would respond to various prices for non-durable goods is not just about numbers; it’s about creating a meaningful dialogue, understanding perceptions, and making potential customers feel valued in the product development process. When approached with care and genuine interest, this interaction becomes a valuable part of the journey towards mutual value creation.\nTable 7.1 provides a small sample of demand data using this approach where 23 potential target customers were asked the quantity they were willing to purchase at every price in a series. The data are in a tibble named pq_data and here is a glimpse() of that data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n$0.00\n$0.50\n$1.00\n$1.50\n$2.00\n$2.50\n3.00\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n5\n4\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n4\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n10\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n10\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n6\n5\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n2\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n2\n2\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n4\n4\n4\n4\n3\n3\n2\n\n\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n8\n2\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nQuantity (total)\n81.00\n44.00\n28.00\n21.00\n13.00\n7.00\n6.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: Quantity demanded by the sample as the sum of quantity demanded of each respondent at various named prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Price-Quantity Variables\nQuantity data usually come survey platforms in the format we see in Table 7.1. We ask how many they would buy at $0.00, $1.00, etc and the survey platform sets up each price as a column for responses. Unfortunately, this data format is not tidy.\nHaving tidy data means that every column is a variable and every row is an observation. The columns of this data are for each price in the series we named. In other words, they are values of an underlying price variable rather than different variables. We really ony have have two variables here, price and the quantity the respondent would buy at that price. To tidy the data, we use R’s pivot_longer() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructing your AI prompt:\n\n\n\nThe pivot_longer() code we need is not very intuitive for your AI to understand. In other words, the prompt you give it needs to be very specific or it will give you code that does something different from what you need. I recommend laying it out as a list. If you edit the following to match the particulars of your data, it should work reliably.\nTo transform your data using pivot_longer(), follow these detailed steps:\n\nProvide a Glimpse of Your Tibble: Run the glimpse() function on your data and share the output with your AI. Use this format:\n“Here is a glimpse of my data:”\n(Then paste the output of glimpse(your_tibble_name))\nSpecify Columns for Transformation: Clearly state which columns you need to transform. For instance:\n“I want to use pivot_longer() on columns q_p_050 to q_p_250.”\nDefine New Column Names:\n“The values from these columns should be placed in a new column named quantity.”\n“The names of these columns should become values in a new column named price.”\nProvide Column Name to Value Conversion: Explain how column names should be converted to values:\n“For the conversion, q_p_050 should become 0.50, q_p_100 should become 1.00, and so on.”\n\n\n\nAfter receiving the code:\n\nVerify Column Count: Ensure you have the correct number of columns. You should see two new columns (price and quantity), and the original columns in the specified range should be gone.\nVerify Row Count: The number of rows in the transformed tibble should equal the number of original price values multiplied by the rows in the original tibble.\n\nThis structured approach will help AI provide you with the most accurate code for your requirements.\nHere is the text of a sample prompt that can be edited, copied, and pasted directly into your AI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI prompt for calculating price and quantity\n\n\n\n“Here is a glimpse(tb) … Please provide the tidyverse code to pivot_longer() on the columns q_p_050 to q_p_250 where the column values should be named quantity and the column names are the values of a variable named price. Note that the column names need to be converted to values q_p_050 = 0.50, q_p_100 = 1.00, etc.”\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Assuming your data frame is named pq_data\npq_long &lt;- pq_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), \n               names_to = \"price\", \n               values_to = \"quantity\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(price = parse_number(gsub(\"\\\\$\", \"\", price)))\n\n\n?tbl-wtp-q-data provides 10 rows out of the 161 rows of the tidy demand data where every row is the quantity that an individual respondent would buy at the named price. The tibble is made longer to have 161 rows because the data are pivoted to show 7 rows (one for each price) for every one of the 23 respondents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprice\nquantity\n\n\n\n\n0.0\n10\n\n\n0.5\n5\n\n\n1.0\n4\n\n\n1.5\n2\n\n\n2.0\n2\n\n\n2.5\n1\n\n\n3.0\n1\n\n\n0.0\n1\n\n\n0.5\n0\n\n\n1.0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.2: Tidy data of the quantities that would be purchased at every price by every respondent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate the Demand Curve\nThe data in the new tibble pq_long are tidy because we have one column for each of price and quantity and every row is an observation of the quantity purchased at each price by each respondent.\nNow lets visualize the relationship:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Visualization of the price quantity relationship of a non-durable good.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variance in the data at every named price makes it more difficult to verify that the data are linear but the impact of price on quantity quantity is clearly negative. We can use linear regression to estimate the model and evaluate the relationship between price and quantity.\n\nEstimation of the Linear Demand Curve\nLet’s first estimate the relationship as linear and then test for a nonlinear demand curve with the demand regression\n\n\nCode\nlinear_demand_model &lt;- lm(quantity ~ price, pq_long)\nsummary(linear_demand_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = quantity ~ price, data = pq_long)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.2174 -0.7547 -0.2671  0.2950  7.2950 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)   2.7050     0.2266  11.937  &lt; 2e-16 ***\nprice        -0.9752     0.1257  -7.758 9.79e-13 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 1.595 on 159 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.2746,    Adjusted R-squared:   0.27 \nF-statistic: 60.19 on 1 and 159 DF,  p-value: 9.787e-13\n\n\nModel Interpretation:\n\nIn terms of overall model fit, we see that the F-statistic of 60.1869097 is significantly different from zero meaning that the model fits well. The R-squared value is 0.2746 meaning that we are explaining 27.46 percent of the variance of quantity. Given the variance we saw in the plot, it is not surprising that the R-squared is not terribly high.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -7.7580223 and a p-value of 9.7873694^{-13} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated demand curve for the non-durable good is \\[ \\mathsf{Q = 2.7049689 -0.9751553 P} \\] for each potential customer. This demand curve suggests that for every $1.00 increase in the price of the non-durable good, the quantity demanded decreases by 0.9752 units of the product per person.\nVisually, it was not clear that the relationship is linear. Not all data exhibit this clear linear relationship so let’s examine it.\n\n\n\nEstimation of the Nonlinear (exponential) Demand Curve\nIn some cases, the demand relationship for non-durable goods follows a nonlinear exponential form, which has the mathematical structure:\n\\[\\mathsf{Q = a \\cdot e^{bP}}\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathsf{e}\\) represents the base for the exponential function (usually computed using exp() in R). Unfortunately, we cannot estimate this nonlinear relationship directly because traditional linear regression assumes the form \\(\\mathsf{y = b_0 + b_1 x}\\), which the exponential demand curve does not conform to.\nHowever, there’s good news! We can transform the data to “linearize” it, making it possible to estimate a linear relationship. To linearize the data, we take the natural logarithm (using log() in R) of both sides of the demand curve equation, resulting in:\n\\[\\mathsf{log(Q) =  \\alpha + bP}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathsf{\\alpha = log(a)}\\). In simpler terms, we log-transform the dependent variable (quantity) and then proceed to estimate a linear regression.\nHere’s the R code to estimate the nonlinear exponential demand curve and the corresponding output:\n\n\nCode\nexponential_demand_model &lt;- lm(log(quantity + 1) ~ price, pq_long)\nsummary(exponential_demand_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(quantity + 1) ~ price, data = pq_long)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.95245 -0.39162 -0.04079  0.33310  1.25850 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)  1.13940    0.07253  15.710   &lt;2e-16 ***\nprice       -0.37389    0.04023  -9.294   &lt;2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 0.5105 on 159 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.352, Adjusted R-squared:  0.3479 \nF-statistic: 86.37 on 1 and 159 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nCode\nsummary(pq_long)\n\n\n     price        quantity     \n Min.   :0.0   Min.   : 0.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.5   1st Qu.: 0.000  \n Median :1.5   Median : 1.000  \n Mean   :1.5   Mean   : 1.242  \n 3rd Qu.:2.5   3rd Qu.: 2.000  \n Max.   :3.0   Max.   :10.000  \n\n\nModel Interpretation:\nFollowing the linearization of the data, we’ve estimated the demand model as a nonlinear exponential demand curve. Notice that because the quantity variable has a minimum value of 0, the log of quantity at the value is not defined so we had to add one (log(quantity + 1)) to be able to run the regression. This means that the regression model is based on \\(\\mathsf{log(quantity + 1)}\\), not directly on \\(\\mathsf{quantity}\\).\nAssessing the goodness of fit, observe that the F-statistic of 86.3706 is significantly different from zero meaning that the model fits well. The R-squared value is 0.352 meaning that we are explaining 35.2 percent of the variance of quantity, implying that the exponential model captures more variation in the data compared to a linear model.\nRegarding the impact of price on quantity, the estimated coefficient for price is negative, in accordance with the law of demand. This coefficient is significantly different from zero, as indicated by the t-value (t-value) and the p-value (p-value), which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated nonlinear exponential demand curve for non-durable goods can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\mathsf{log(Q + 1) = 1.1394 -0.3739 P}\n\\] or \\[\n\\mathsf{Q = e^{1.1394  -0.3739 P} - 1}\n\\] where wtp represents a proxy for price.\nInterpreting the exponential demand curve, for every $1.00 increase in the price of the non-durable good, the logarithm of the quantity demanded across the sample of respondents decreases by 0.3739 units of the product. It’s important to note that interpreting changes in the logarithm of a value may not be intuitive to most individuals.\nThis methodology enables us to estimate the demand curve for non-durable goods and understand how price influences consumer behavior in this context.",

    "section": "7.3 Aggregate Quantity Data at Various Prices",
    "text": "7.3 Aggregate Quantity Data at Various Prices\nIn Section 7.2, we gathered and tidied quantity data provided in response to a series of prices. As we saw the resulting demand curve predicts demand for an individual customer. In Section 5.4.2, we gathered willingness to pay and quantity data that led us to a demand curve for the collective sample of respondents rather than individual respondents.\nIn this section, we will explore how to transition from individual demand curves, represented by price-quantity data for each respondent, to aggregated demand curves that reflect the preferences of the entire sample.\n\nUnderstanding the Transition\nTo begin, let’s briefly clarify the difference between individual and aggregated demand curves:\n\nIndividual Demand Curves: These curves represent the demand behavior of individual consumers. Each respondent’s willingness to pay and corresponding quantity data form a unique demand curve. They provide insights into the preferences of specific consumers.\nAggregated Demand Curves: These curves reflect the combined demand patterns of the entire sample of respondents. They result from aggregating the individual demand data to create a collective representation of demand behavior. These curves aim to capture overall market trends.\n\n\n\nAggregating the Data\n\nGrouping by Price: To aggregate the individual demand data, we start by grouping the data by price. This process consolidates responses at each price point.\nSummarizing Quantity: Next, we summarize the data by calculating the total quantity demanded at each price level. This aggregation process transforms the individual quantity data into collective demand figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt your AI for code for aggregation\n\n\n\nThis is one of those requests that can cause chatGPT to generate many different commands. That means our prompts are often too ambiguous. Here is a template prompt that you can edit and paste into ChatGPT to get the code you need. The key is tell it the tibble name (call it a tibble and you will signal that you want tidyverse code or ask for tidyverse code directly), the price and quantity variables and ask it to aggregate the quantity variable for every price.\n“I have a tibble tb with price and quantity variables. I want to aggregate the quantity variable for every price.”\n\n\nHere’s the R code to achieve this aggregation:\n\n\nCode\n# Grouping data by price and summarizing quantity\naggregated_pq_data &lt;- pq_long |&gt;\n  group_by(price) |&gt;\n  summarise(Q = sum(quantity))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprice\nQ\n\n\n\n\n0.0\n81\n\n\n0.5\n44\n\n\n1.0\n28\n\n\n1.5\n21\n\n\n2.0\n13\n\n\n2.5\n7\n\n\n3.0\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: Price and quantity data aggregated for the sample of 23 respondents.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that aggregation has reduced the data to just seven rows – one for each price we named when collecting data from the respondents. This reduction is unavoidable and usually leaves us with relatively small datasets. The more prices we name during data collection, the greater the bias from survey fatigue.\n\n\nEstimate the Aggregated Demand Curve\nFirst, let’s visualize the aggregated demand data with a scatterplot to gain insights into the overall demand trend. We’ll then proceed to estimate both a linear and exponential demand curve to assess potential nonlinearity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Scatterplot of the relationship between aggregated price and quantity data for the sample or resondents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot in Figure 7.2 shows the same negative relationship in the aggregated data that we saw in the individual data in Figure 7.1 but with less variance. The nonlinear relationship is more pronounced in the aggregated data as well.\n\n\nEstimate the Linear Aggregate Demand\nWe’ll start by estimating a linear demand curve for the aggregated data using regression analysis.\n\n\nCode\naggregate_linear_model &lt;- lm(Q ~ price, aggregated_pq_data)\nsummary(aggregate_linear_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Q ~ price, data = aggregated_pq_data)\n\nResiduals:\n       1        2        3        4        5        6        7 \n 18.7857  -7.0000 -11.7857  -7.5714  -4.3571   0.8571  11.0714 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The R-squared value is 0.9875 meaning that we are explaining 98.75 percent of the variance of quantity. The increase in R-squared and F-statistic suggest that the demand curve is indeed an exponential form.\nIn terms of the impact of price on quantity, we see that the estimated coefficient for price is negative as the law of demand dictates. We also see that the estimated coefficient of price is significantly different from zero with a t-value of -19.8397858 and a p-value of 6.0099318^{-6} which is very close to zero.\nThe estimated exponential aggregate demand curve for the non-durable good is \\[\n\\mathsf{log(Q) = 4.2924 -0.8751 P}\n\\] or \\[\n\\mathsf{Q = e^{4.2924  -0.8751 P}}\n\\]",

    "text": "8.1 Introduction\nCost is the money you pay to do the things you do to deliver value to your customers. The importance of cost is simple: if your cost exceeds your revenue, your business won’t be sustainable. Every dollar saved on costs is as valuable as an extra dollar of revenue.\nCost Structure: The cost structure is a crucial concept—it’s about how much of your costs are fixed and how much are variable. Some businesses operate with hardly any fixed costs but have higher variable cost for each unit sold. Others might have significant fixed costs, but very low costs per unit.\nYour startup’s cost structure isn’t just happenstance; it’s a result of strategic decisions, much like your revenue model. The way you choose to serve your customers—a high fixed-cost model with everything in-house, or a variable-cost model relying on outsourced services—affects both your initial investment and your ongoing expenses.\nKeep in mind, your chosen cost structure dictates the kind of solutions you can offer. Not all cost structures can support the same solutions, and the most effective solution isn’t always the most cost-effective one.\nSelecting a cost structure is as fundamental as choosing how and when to invest in the resources that will become your fixed costs. Understanding the nature of your costs is the first step towards making informed decisions about your business’s financial future.",

    "text": "8.2 The Nature of Cost\nCosts are the sum of all expenses a business incurs to produce and deliver its services or products, encompassing everything from labor to utilities. These costs define how a business allocates its resources and sets prices.\n\nTotal Cost\nTotal cost reflects the entire expense of producing a given level of output in a period of time. It’s critical to understand that while historical data often inform cost analyses in existing companies, entrepreneurs must instead estimate future costs to make informed decisions. Without historical data to rely on, we typically forecast a linear approximation of total costs, such as\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\mathsf{C} &= \\mathsf{cQ + f}  \\\\\n           &= \\mathsf{50\\,000 + 200\\ Q}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathsf{C}\\) is total cost, \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is the variable cost per unit, \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is the fixed cost and \\(\\mathsf{cQ}\\) is the total variable cost.\nBefore revenue, you will typically have complete knowledge of your future variable and fixed costs. As your business evolves and you gather actual data, these cost functions can be refined.\nUnderstanding the composition of total costs is foundational. Fixed costs, like rent, remain constant regardless of output levels. Variable costs, such as materials and labor, fluctuate with production volume. The interplay of these costs dictates pricing strategies and potential profit margins.\nThe relationship between fixed and variable costs, and their total, is illustrated in Figure 8.1, where the fixed cost is \\(\\mathsf{ f = 50\\, 000}\\) and the variable cost per unit \\(\\mathsf{c = 200}\\) is the rate at which total cost rises as quantity increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Measures of Total Cost\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurs must navigate these concepts with both foresight and flexibility to build a sustainable cost structure for their ventures.\n\n\nUnit Costs\nUnderstanding unit costs is imperative for businesses to ensure they price their products or services appropriately. It’s not merely about covering total costs but also ensuring each unit sold contributes to the overall financial health of the business. Unit costs, also known as “cost per unit,” refer to the cost incurred by a company to produce, store, and sell one unit of a particular product or service. This measure is crucial for businesses to calculate in order to set appropriate selling prices, determine break-even points, and strategize for profitability. Unit costs can be broken down into various components, such as:\n\nAverage Total Cost (ATC)\nThis is the total cost of production divided by the number of units produced. It encompasses all costs, both fixed and variable, averaged over all units of output. The formula for ATC is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\mathsf{ATC} &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{C}{Q}} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{f + cQ}{Q}} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{50\\, 000 + 200Q}{Q}} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{50\\, 000}{Q} + 200}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nWe can see that average total cost ATC comprises average fixed cost and average variable cost.\nIf the chosen price of a product is below the ATC, it may be unsustainable to enter the market or continue operations. The equation for ATC often highlights the benefits of economies of scale – as production increases, the fixed cost contribution per unit decreases, potentially lowering the ATC.\n\n\nAverage Variable Cost\nAverage variable cost (AVC) specifically looks at the costs that vary with production. Keeping prices above AVC is crucial in the short run to ensure a business isn’t operating at a loss. This measure helps in making incremental production decisions, especially when considering the minimum price at which it’s viable to keep producing.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\mathsf{AVC} &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{VC}{Q}} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{cQ}{Q} = c} \\\\[9pt]\n             &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{200Q}{Q} = 200}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nMarginal Cost\nMarginal cost (MC) represents the cost of producing one additional unit. In a linear cost model, the marginal cost is constant and identical to average variable cost, simplifying decision-making. It’s vital for making informed decisions about increasing or decreasing production levels and for setting competitive prices.\nThese unit cost measures are visually represented in Figure 8.2, allowing for a clearer understanding of the cost implications at different production levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Measures of Unit Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime and Cost: The Short-Run vs. The Long-Run\nThe perspective on what constitutes a fixed or a variable cost can shift based on the time frame considered. In the short run, certain costs are fixed because the firm’s scale of operations cannot be adjusted quickly— for example, the rent for a factory. In the long run, as the firm has the opportunity to adjust its scale of operations, these costs become variable.\nThus, the categorization of costs as fixed or variable is less about the nature of the cost itself and more about the firm’s ability to modify these costs within a given time frame. This time sensitivity is crucial in strategic planning, as it influences the flexibility of a business to adapt to market changes and manage its cost structure for sustainable growth.\n\n\nFixed costs vs. Sunk Costs\nFixed costs and sunk costs are often conflated but they have differences that are important in making decisions about investments in infrastructure that increases fixed costs. Here’s a detailed look at the differences between the two and how they relate to decision-making:\n\nFixed Costs\nFixed costs are business expenses that remain unchanged regardless of the level of production or sales. These costs are “fixed” over a specified period and do not fluctuate with the volume of output. Examples include rent, salaries of permanent employees, depreciation of machinery, and insurance. These are costs a company incurs just for being in business, whether it produces anything or not.\nFixed costs can sometimes be altered or eliminated, but this usually requires a strategic shift or long-term planning. For example, a company might relocate to a cheaper facility or downsize its staff to reduce its fixed costs.\n\n\nSunk Costs\nSunk costs, on the other hand, are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. They are “sunk” because they are past expenditures that can no longer be affected by current or future actions. For instance, if a company invests in research and development for a product that it later decides not to produce, the money spent on R&D is a sunk cost.\nSunk costs should not influence future business decisions since they cannot be recovered or changed. However, businesses and individuals often fall prey to the “sunk cost fallacy,” where they continue investing in a project due to the amount already spent, rather than based on future viability.\n\n\nDecision-Making and Cost\nIn decision-making, particularly within economics, it’s essential to focus on relevant costs which include opportunity costs and incremental costs. Opportunity costs represent the benefits a business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. Incremental costs are the additional costs incurred when making business decisions, such as producing additional units.\nOpportunity Cost: This is the cost of the next best alternative that is foregone when a decision is made. It’s the value of what you could have done versus what you actually chose to do.\nIncremental Cost: When comparing options, it’s the additional cost over the current expenditure. It’s crucial for decision-makers to consider incremental costs rather than sunk costs because they reflect the potential future impact of decisions.\n\n\nAccounting vs. Economic Perspective\nAccounting: From an accounting standpoint, sunk costs are recognized and cannot typically be adjusted. They are recorded as they are incurred and may affect overall profitability.\nFinance: In finance, particularly when conducting cash flow analysis, the timing of cost recovery is crucial. Fixed costs that can be recovered, such as through the sale of an asset, are considered when calculating the net present value or internal rate of return.\nEconomics: Economists consider only those costs that can affect future decisions. Sunk costs are irrelevant to future economic decision-making because they do not change regardless of the outcome of future events.\nUnderstanding the difference between fixed and sunk costs is vital in making informed decisions that affect the economic health of a company. Decision-makers must look beyond past investments (sunk costs) and focus on the costs and benefits that can be influenced by their decisions (incremental and opportunity costs).\n\n\n\nCost Structure and the Business Model\nLet’s explore the relationship between cost structure and the business model. We choose both the cost structure and the business model and both need to be taken into account because different business models inherently have different cost implications:\n\nProduction Revenue Model\n\nVariable Costs: These include costs that vary with production volume such as raw materials, inventory costs, piece-rate labor (wages paid per unit produced), and sales commissions that are tied directly to the number of units sold.\nFixed Costs: Costs that remain constant regardless of production volume, such as salaries for management, costs related to the manufacturing facility, equipment, and general overhead.\n\nRetail Revenue Model\n\nVariable Costs: In a retail environment, the variable costs mainly consist of the cost of goods sold (purchases of inventory that will be resold) and sales commissions if applicable.\nFixed Costs: The costs of operating a retail space (rent, utilities, etc.), purchasing staff salaries, and general overhead expenses remain fixed.\n\nLicensing Revenue Model\n\nVariable Costs: For a licensing model, the costs that vary with the number of licenses sold could include sales commissions and legal costs for drafting and enforcing contracts.\nFixed Costs: The substantial investments in research and development (R&D) to create the intellectual property (IP), and the legal costs associated with securing IP rights (patents, copyrights, trademarks).\n\n\n\nScalability Challenges\n\nLabor-Intensive Solutions: Businesses that rely heavily on human labor (like consulting or teaching) are less scalable because costs increase linearly with revenue. To grow, you need to hire more people, and profit margins don’t significantly improve due to the proportional increase in labor costs.\nAsset-Intensive Solutions: For businesses that require physical assets like property or buildings, scaling up often means acquiring more assets, which leads to a proportional increase in costs relative to revenues.\n\n\n\nCost Structure and Profitability\n\nScalability and Margins: The ideal business model is one where costs do not grow at the same pace as revenues, allowing profit margins to increase with scale. Web-based solutions are a prime example, as they require minimal additional costs for serving additional customers, thus scaling effectively.\nTrade-off Between Fixed and Variable Costs: Investing in scalable fixed assets can often reduce variable costs and allow for better scalability. However, such fixed costs can be significant and challenging for entrepreneurs to fund, especially in the early stages of a startup.\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurial Challenges\nFor entrepreneurs, particularly in the startup phase, there is often a tension between the desire to invest in scalable assets and the reality of limited funds. This often results in a reliance on higher variable costs due to a lack of capital to invest in fixed, scalable assets. Entrepreneurs must navigate this trade-off while seeking funding sources that can support investments in assets that will help them scale more effectively in the long run.\nIn essence, the choice of business model and the resulting cost structure are crucial in determining how easily a business can scale and how its profitability will change as it grows.",

    "section": "8.4 Choosing a Cost Structure",
    "text": "8.4 Choosing a Cost Structure\n\nEarly Stages\n\nBootstrapping Phase: Startups often begin with minimal fixed costs; operating out of a free space and covering expenses via personal means, maintaining flexibility by using external services.\nCost Minimization: The goal is to keep fixed costs low until there is proof of demand for the product, thus avoiding unnecessary financial burdens.\n\n\n\nGrowth and Scaling\n\nInitial Growth: As the product gains market traction or investment is secured, the startup can afford to incur more fixed costs like office space and salaries.\nHiring Key Talent: Skilled professionals are brought on board to refine and build the product.\nFounder Compensation: Founders may start with modest salaries, their main compensation being the growing value of their equity.\n\n\n\nMaturation\n\nEstablished Presence: A successful venture with significant market share may invest in permanent assets, such as buildings, and start developing a more hierarchical structure.\nProfessional Management: The operational complexity may lead to the hiring of professional executives to manage the company’s growth and operations effectively.\n\n\n\nCost Structure Transition\nThe decision to shift from a lower fixed cost structure to a higher one depends on the company’s scale and its ability to cover fixed costs. Figure 8.3 shows how total costs vary with different ratios of fixed to variable costs, illustrating the optimal points for transitioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Choose the cost structure that minimizes cost at the level of scale (production or sales)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Decisions\n\nAvoid Premature Fixed Costs: Entrepreneurs should resist investing in large fixed assets too early, as customer needs and solutions are still evolving.\nIncremental Investments: It is advisable to gradually improve the product with a focus on adaptability, even if that means higher variable costs initially.\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Startups\n\nStartups should carefully assess when to transition to a cost structure with higher fixed costs.\nThe goal is to minimize costs at the current level of scale, avoiding the trap of scaling fixed costs too quickly which could lead to unprofitability.\nThe timing of these transitions is critical and can be guided by analyzing cost curves and scale of operations.\n\nThis provides a strategic framework for startups to consider when scaling their operations, emphasizing the importance of aligning cost structures with stages of growth and the inherent risks of moving too quickly into high fixed costs without the sales volume to support them. It is a crucial guide for entrepreneurs to understand the financial implications of growth and scale in the context of a startup lifecycle.\n\n\n\nThe Decision to Make or to Buy\nThe make-or-buy decision shapes your startup’s cost structure at a fundamental level. Producing goods in-house generally ramps up fixed costs due to the need for equipment, space, and expertise. On the other hand, procuring goods from a supplier increases variable costs, as you pay for their production plus a margin.\nConventional wisdom advocates for startups to purchase inputs, conserving resources to innovate on what can’t be bought. The challenge lies in discerning when it’s financially wiser to produce rather than purchase.\nPurchasing inputs can shift substantial fixed costs to the supplier, leaving your startup with higher variable costs. However, the total purchase cost may exceed in-house production if the supplier’s profit margin is steep. Alternatively, a supplier’s specialized operations can result in lower costs for you, even with their profit margin included.\n\nTransaction Costs\nWhen buying, consider transaction costs—the risk and governance expenses in transactions (Williamson 1975, 1985). Suppliers can falter, causing holdups that delay your operations. Contracts and strong relationships are governance mechanisms that reduce such risks, but in cases of significant holdup risk, in-house production might safeguard your startup’s future.\nEntrepreneurial decisions should weigh these transaction costs. For low-risk inputs, buying is typically safe. For high-risk inputs, manufacturing internally may be essential. Refer to Section 8.7 (Appendix A) for an in-depth analysis of transaction cost economics and the make-or-buy conundrum.",

It is made of slash resistant fabric in nondescript colors to avoid the attention that more popular colorful brands draw. Let’s look at the cost of having the Dorsal pack manufactured by a contract manufacturer. The manufacturer charges $40 per backpack to be manufactured, packaged, and delivered to the start-up’s offices. The start up is also spending $200 per month for web hosting and $5500 per month for contracted web development. Their total cost curve is linear: \\[ \\mathsf{C = cQ + f}\\] where \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is the variable cost per unit and \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is fixed cost per month.\n\nIn homework 2, we studied revenue models for the Dorsal travel pack. In this homework, we will continue the analysis by focusing on cost of the backpack.\n\n\nWhat is the variable cost per unit for the Dorsal pack?\nWhat is the average variable cost of producing and selling 32 Dorsal packs?\nWhat is the fixed cost per month?\nWhat is the total cost of the first 62 units?\nWhat is the total variable cost of 37 units?\nWhat is the total fixed cost of 75 units?\nWhat is average total cost of 43 units?\nInvesting in new cost structure: Like most start-ups in the early days, Dorsal pack has embraced a cost structure with low fixed costs and high variable costs. In the next stage of business model development, they are considering doing the packaging and order fulfillment themselves. In this scenario, the manufacturer would ship to the finished product in bulk to Dorsal’s headquarters. Without packaging, the manufacturing cost is $25. A single person can manage the packaging and order fulfillment operation once it is set up. The cost of setting up packaging and fulfillment operations is $16,000 per month. This cost is in addition to the fixed costs from original cost structure that will remain in the new cost structure. How many travel packs does Dorsal need to sell per month to justify moving to the new cost structure by investing in packaging and fulfillment? \n\nNote that you can use a ggplot with a layer for each function (using geom_function twice) to roughly find the point where two functions intersect. However, to know the precise value where intersection happens, you first create a new function that is the difference between the functions (f1intersect2 &lt;- function(x) f1(x) - f2(x)). Then use the package rootsolve (you will probably need to install it) to find the roots of the new function. When the difference between the functions is equal to zero, they have intersected one another. The syntax for using rootsolve is uniroot(f1m2, lower = #, upper = #) where lower = and upper = provide the values of \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) that are the lower bound and upper bound to search for the intersection.\nThe impact of pricing on cost:. We have been working with cost as a function of quantity which is traditional. However, we will normally make the pricing decision to tell us what the quantity demanded will be. To incorporate price into decisions about cost, just insert the demand curve \\(\\mathsf{Q(P)}\\) in place of the quantity variable in the cost equations. In the case of the Dorsal travel pack, we estimated the demand curve in Homework 1 and 2 to be \\(\\mathsf{Q_{dp} = e^{5.115604 - 0.011612\\cdot P}}\\).\n\nUsing this demand curve, what is the expected total cost when we set the price at $100?\n\nWhat is the average total cost when the price of a dorsal pack is $200?",

    "section": "8.7 Appendix A: Clarifying the Make-Buy Decision through Transaction Cost Economics",
    "text": "8.7 Appendix A: Clarifying the Make-Buy Decision through Transaction Cost Economics\nA common question that entrepreneurs face is whether to make a particular input to their solution or to buy it from a supplier. For example, a startup with a software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution needs a great deal of computing capacity to serve the customer needs that come from around the globe. Should the startup buy, host, and maintain its own web servers or should it contract with one of the many cloud computing providers? For a SAAS startup, the wisdom of ``buying everything you can’’ means that a contract provider of cloud computing should be used. When you consider the costs and hassles of buying, installing, maintaining, and securing the computers, it sounds logical to let the experts focus on their strength in computer hardware while the startup focuses on its expertise in building a software solution.\nMuch like the concept of opportunity cost, transaction costs often do not show up in the direct and indirect accounting costs of making and delivering your solution. As a result, it is easy to neglect or ignore the influence of transaction costs in your decisions. When transaction costs are large, ignoring them can lead to decisions that are very costly and even fatal to your company.\nThe risk of holdup demands governance mechanisms to facilitate transactions. Let’s first explore the factors that lead to the risk of holdup: uncertainty, bounded rationality, opportunism, and asset specificity. When there is certainty about a transaction or the markets of the supplier and the buyer, there is no risk of opportunism. If you are certain about what will happen, there will be no surprises and you will only transact if it is safe.\nWhen there is uncertainty, surprises happen. When there is uncertainty, it is not possible to write a fully contingent contract–one where every possible contingency is addressed and agreed upon—so the unexpected can happen to either or both of the transactors. Surprises often lead to unexpected problems that make it impossible to fulfill the terms of the contract and holdup happens. Uncertainty causes the parties to a transaction to have bounded rationality meaning that their ability to foresee and specify risks is limited. Since we all have limits to our rationality, especially in our ability to see through uncertainty, you must evaluate the risk of holdup in our transactions.\nSome suppliers are more trustworthy than others. Usually, you perceive that a supplier is less trustworthy because they show a tendency or a history of opportunism. Opportunism is a willingness to take advantage of the other party in a transaction, even resorting to guile to take advantage and get ahead. It is not necessary for every possible transactor to be opportunistic. It is not even necessary for one of the transactors of a particular transaction to be opportunistic. If there is uncertainty and you can not be sure that the other transactor is honest, the risk of opportunism is present and you must respond to it.\nSome inputs to your solution will be generic type inputs for which there are many competing suppliers competing in commodity markets to sell to you. Other inputs are specific to the transaction and open the door to holdup. A specific asset is one that cannot be redeployed to new uses if the transaction fails. The inability to redeploy the asset means that it is closely related to the sunk costs we discussed in Section 8.2.4.\nTo see the relationship between asset specificity and the risk of holdup, consider the case of injection molding. Injection molding, as the name suggests, injects a material into a mold to quickly produce a physical part in a desired shape. The mold must be created to exacting standards to produce the desired shape of the finished part. As a result, it can almost never be used in another application. We would say that the mold is an asset that is specific to the transaction for that particular molded part. The high degree of asset-specificity of the mold is the primary source of the risk of holdup. Once the molding company has incurred the cost of creating the mold, that cost is sunk. The buyer can come back to the supplier and demand a price reduction. Since the cost of the mold is sunk, the supplier has little leverage and will likely have to give in.\nWhen assets are highly specific to the transaction and the risk of opportunism is high, the transaction costs may be so high that transactions never happen. In practice, transactions between customers and suppliers of injection molding because the customer is required to buy the molds.\nTransaction cost economics identifies at least six types of asset specificity that raise the risk of holdup:\n\nSite Specificity: when a supplier locates production near a buyer, or vice versa, for the sake of lower transportation costs and increased coordination, the cost of relocating and the cost of changing suppliers increases;\nPhysical Asset Specificity: when a physical asset can only do one thing for one buyer, it cannot be redeployed and the risk of holdup increases;\nHuman Asset Specificity: when employees develop knowledge and skills that can only be used in a particular employer, the cost of the employee leaving is higher for both the employee and the firm;\nTemporal Specificity: when there is a window of opportunity after which value is lost such as in earning an on-time delivery bonus or earning a first-mover advantage, buyers are vulnerable to suppliers who are slow to deliver;\nDedicated Assets: when a customer invests in assets for a particular supplier or when a supplier invests in assets for a particular customer, the cost of redeploying the may be very high if it is even possible;\nBrand-name Capital: brand equity is tied to the firm that developed it and is difficult to transfer to another firm or brand. It is harder to build brand equity than to sustain it so firms with brand equity are vulnerable to firms who can damage it without damaging their own brand.\n\nThe risk of holdup threatens to derail transactions when the risk is particularly high. The solution is to implement a governance mechanism that reduces the risk of holdup to levels that allow transactions to proceed. We saw an example of a governance mechanism in the transactions for injection molding. The supplier requires the buyer to pay for the mold before the mold is built. Because the buyer bears the fixed cost, the primary opportunity for the buyer’s opportunism is eliminated. This particular governance mechanism is known as where the giving of a hostage (the molds) aligns the incentives of the buyer and the supplier and allows them to transact with confidence.\nThere are three primary categories of governance mechanisms with varying effectiveness in eliminating holdup cost. The first category is the spot market which is sometimes known as “cash and carry.” For example, if you need paper for your printer, you typically go to a retailer, give them cash, and carry away the paper. This governance mechanism is weakest in terms of reducing the risk of holdup but it is also the cheapest and easiest to implement. When the risk of holdup is low enough, it works well.\nAt the other extreme of the governance mechanism continuum is hierarchy which means that the transaction happens inside the hierarchy of the company. Hierarchy is a very powerful governance mechanism because even when there is high asset specificity, the risk of holdup is low. If one division of a company exercises opportunism against another division of the same company, the opportunistic division may be better off but the company is injured overall. An executive of the company can rein in the opportunistic division, sort out the differences and ensure a collective benefit for the company. The downside of hierarchy is that it is expensive. A new division of the company has to be formed; new employees and managers must be brought in and trained; new executives and executive responsibilities must be adopted; and coordination between divisions grows geometrically as the number of divisions grows.\nBetween the extremes of market and hierarchy is the hybrid category which contains elements of market and hierarchy. The simplest hybrid form is a contract that defines how the buyer and the seller will act under various contingencies. A contract is more effective than the spot market in overcoming the risk of holdup but it is more expensive in terms of contracting costs and coordination. A contract is less effective than hierarchy in overcoming holdup because courts must be used to resolve disputes but it is cheaper to set up and coordinate. Alliances, joint ventures, and franchises are additional forms of hybrid governance mechanisms. Each is closer to hierarchy than contracts and more effective in reducing holdup but also more expensive.\nWhile governance mechanisms are effective in reducing or eliminating the risk of holdup, their cost must be included in the total transaction cost. The total transaction cost is the sum of the cost of the governance mechanism and the cost of the remaining risk of holdup. The varying governance mechanisms have varying costs. In general, more effective governance mechanisms are also more expensive to implement and are only cost effective when the risk of holdup is high such as when there is high asset specificity. This insight is illustrated in Figure 8.4, adapted from Oliver Williamson (1985), where we see the cost of the governance mechanism graphed against the degree of asset specificity which directly causes the risk of holdup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Choosing Governance Mechanisms to Minimize Transaction Costs\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asset specificity is low, spot market governance works well and has a low cost. However, as asset specificity grows, the cost of governance using spot markets grows much faster due to the cost of monitoring, coordinating, and the cost of holdup. When there is no asset specificity, the hybrid governance mechanism has a higher cost than markets because of the cost of setting up legal contracts and coordination. With very low asset specificity, hybrid governance is a poor choice. As asset specificity rises, the cost of governance rises and eventually hybrid governance becomes the least expensive choice for moderate levels of asset specificity. In the absence of asset specificity, hierarchy is the most expensive governance mechanism. As asset specificity rises, the cost of governance rises more slowly so that hierarchy is the least expensive choice for high levels of asset specificity. The choice of appropriate governance mechanism is straightforward. Choose the mechanism that minimizes the transaction costs given the level of asset specificity.\nWhat does this mean for the entrepreneur? The debate over which inputs to make and which to buy is best resolved through the lens of transaction cost economics. The traditional wisdom is that entrepreneurs should buy every input they can. This is good advice for inputs with low asset specificity where spot markets can be used and for inputs with moderate asset specificity where contracts or partnerships can be used. In contrast, when asset specificity for a transaction for an input is high and the risk of holdup is also high, you are better off to make that input. Even when it is available to be purchased in the market, the risk of holdup is so high that the well-being of your startup is in jeopardy when you buy the input rather than make it.",

    "text": "8.8 Appendix B: Economies and Diseconomies of Scale\nThere are diverse reasons why average total cost falls as scale increases. The primary reason is the spreading of fixed costs over more units sold. On top of that, economies of scale may result from increased efficiency as scale increases.\n\nEconomies of Scale\n\nProduct-Specific Economies of Scale\nThese economies of scale are associated with the volume of a single product.\n\nAt higher volumes, specialized investments in machines and human capital (both R&D and production) allow for production methods that reduce the cost per unit. In particular, labor costs decrease due to increases in proficiency as well as fewer errors per unit. For example, in ball bearing manufacturing, production of less than 100 rings is done by hand on general purpose lathes. For production between 100 – 1,000,000 rings, production is done with a specialized screw machine. For production greater than 1,000,000 rings, production is done with an even more specialized high speed, continuous process machine.\nIncreased bargaining power in procuring raw materials/inputs decreases the cost of raw material inputs.\n\n\n\nPlant-Specific Economies of Scale\nThese economies of scale are associated with the total output of an entire plant.\n\nEfficiency gains that result from expanding the size of individual processing units and sharing plant costs across several related products (e.g., procurement, inventory management/receiving, transportation/distribution). These types of efficiency gains are\nEnergy usage — rises less than proportionately with increases in processing size.\nLabor — crews required to operate a large processing unit or machine are often no larger than what is needed for a unit with smaller capacity.\nMassed reserves — lower costs for back-up of specialized machines (e.g. you need a back-up if you have one or five machines running). Fewer maintenance personnel are required per machine/plant; also useful when unit/machine shutdowns occur regularly and predictably.\n\n\n\nEconomies of Multi-Plant Operations\nThese economies of scale are associated with total corporate size.\n\nEconomies of scale in centralized service functions, such as R&D and management/staff. Costs per unit are lower by having a common central pool of researchers, financial planners, accountants, purchasing agents, lawyers, etc.\nValue of experimentation and diversity of operations wherein knowledge from one plant can be transferred to other plants. Shared production experience (best demonstrated practices) across plants can increase efficiency.\nEconomies of scale in raising capital through common stock issues and borrowing. For example, firms with $200 mm in assets borrow on average at 0.74 percentage points less than $5 mm asset firms; $1 billion asset firms borrow for 1.08 percentage points less. (1960’s; Scherer et al.) This is due to reduced variance in profits (lower perceived risk). The CAPM pricing model is typically used to assess risk and even one bad year of earnings is perceived as a trend. Thus, larger companies in more concentrated industries have lower Betas. Also, a firm of $500 mm assets can borrow $25 mm at close to the prime rate but if it tries to borrow $100 - 500 mm in a short time frame, it will have to pay a steep interest premium. Such capital market imperfections may contribute to concentration in capital intensive industries like steel, autos, petrol. refining, etc., requiring a very high capital investment for minimum efficient scale (MES) operation. Small competitors may have considerable difficulty financing a great leap forward in MES operation.\nEconomies of scale in advertising which allow you to achieve a “minimum threshold” of advertising messages to influence the consumer; however, above the minimum threshold at some point there appears to be diminishing returns to advertising. (e.g., according to reports, some beer drinkers deluged with Budweiser ads, said, “Give me anything but a Bud.”)\nThe ability to locate plants to reduce distribution/transportation costs associated with getting the product to the end user (e.g. especially with low value to bulk items or items with special distribution properties like ice, dairy products, cement, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nDiseconomies of Scale\nIt is common for diseconomies of scale to exist as well as economies of scale. When there are diseconomies of scale, average total cost rises as the scale increases. Diseconomies of scale typically occur when increasing marginal costs outweigh the advantages of spreading fixed cost and the average cost rises.\n%For many firms, there are also observed ranges of output that exhibit diseconomies of scale. Over these ranges, average cost is rising as output increases.\nDiseconomies of scale put limits on scale and complicate efforts to realize the cost advantages of economies of scale. Reasons for diseconomies of scale include\n\nDiminishing returns to scale economies—with large enough volume, set-up costs dwindle to insignificance. %Learning curves flatten.\nPsychological surveys show that for reasons not completely understood workers are less satisfied with jobs and challenges offered in large plants vs. small. Therefore, to attract the required work force, you need to pay a wage premium.\nIncreasing the workforce in a small town may require expanding the geographic radius from which workers are drawn; this increases commuting costs and results in higher offsetting wages.\nMaterial flows lengthen and become more complex; managing a large plant is more difficult than a small one, all things being equal. Typically, the larger the plant, the more decisions are made at higher levels by executives who are removed farther and farther from the reality of front line production.\nTransportation costs typically increase with fewer, larger plants, both in transporting inputs to the plant and finished products to the market, because fewer plants cannot be located as closely to their destinations.\nRisks of fire, explosion, wildcat strikes are at a maximum when all production is concentrated at a single plant site.",

    "text": "9.1 Economies of Scale\nThe cost structure of a company is shaped fundamentally by strategic decisions regarding what to produce in-house and what to procure from external sources. Opting to purchase inputs typically diminishes our fixed costs but can result in a higher variable cost per unit. Conversely, choosing to manufacture goods internally may elevate fixed costs but often leads to a decrease in variable costs per unit. As a firm invests in infrastructure and decides on its mix of make-or-buy, its cost structure inevitably evolves. Beyond these structural decisions, other influential forces dynamically shape costs. Chief among these are two pivotal concepts: economies of scale and the learning curve. Each plays a crucial role in the evolution of a firm’s cost profile over time and, if leveraged astutely, can endow a strategic advantage.\nEconomies of scale refer to the cost advantage that arises with increased output. The basic premise is simple: as production scales up, the average total cost (ATC) of each unit declines. This happens due to the spreading of fixed costs over a larger number of units and the potential for increased operational efficiency that larger production volumes can afford. For a start-up or a growing business, recognizing the point where economies of scale kick in can mean the difference between thriving and merely surviving.\nOn the other hand, the learning curve concept deals with unit cost dynamics as a function of cumulative production experience. It’s grounded in the observation that work becomes more efficient over time. The more often a task is performed, the lower the time and cost to complete future units becomes. This phenomenon can lead to significant cost reductions and is independent of the scale of operations, although it often complements economies of scale.\nTogether, these concepts describe the cost dynamics that are central to the strategic decision-making of an entrepreneur. They underscore the importance of production planning, workforce training, and technological investment. Balancing the immediate costs of expansion and training against long-term cost savings is a delicate act but one that can lead to a sustained competitive advantage. The ensuing sections will delve deeper into how these dynamics operate, their underlying principles, and how entrepreneurs can harness them to build efficient, cost-effective businesses.",

    "text": "What Are Economies of Scale?\nImagine your business is a ship. At first, sailing a small boat, every wave feels like a mountain. But as your ship grows, those waves become less daunting. This is what happens with your costs when your business scales up. Economies of scale occur when increasing the volume of production leads to a lower cost per unit. This is a sweet spot for entrepreneurs, where growing bigger means becoming more cost-efficient.\n\n\nWhy Does ATC Fall with Q?\n\nSpreading of Fixed Costs: Like a jar of peanut butter, the more bread you have to spread it on, the thinner you can spread it. The fixed costs (rent, machinery) get spread over more units, reducing the cost for each one. This effect is visible in the basic equation in the term \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{f}{Q}}\\) which is always decreasing as quantity increases. Economies of scale are primarily generated by the spreading of fixed costs and secondarily by increased productivity.\n\nFor example, larger manufacturing plants may see benefits like less energy use per unit or shared costs over multiple products. Similarly, big firms can often secure capital cheaper or spread R&D costs across the entire company.\nIncreased Productivity: As you produce more, your team learns and improves. Processes become more efficient, reducing the time (and hence cost) needed for each unit. This effect is less visible in the basic equation. If the process becomes more efficient, we should be able to make the same output with fewer resources and lower cost. That means that we would expect the unit cost \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) to be a function of quantity \\(\\mathsf{c(Q)}\\) that decreases as quantity increases.\n\nFor example, investments in specialized machinery or staff training to increase proficiency and reduce errors lowers costs as production scales.\n\n\n\nThe Basic Equation\nIn simple terms, the average total cost (ATC) decreases as the quantity of output (Q) increases. Remember that the basic equation for cost is\n\\[ \\mathsf{C = f + cQ}\\] where\n\n\\(\\mathsf{C}\\) is total cost;\n\\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is fixed cost and doesn’t change with quantity;\n\\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is unit cost; and\n\\(\\mathsf{cQ}\\) is variable cost and changes directly with quantity.\n\nThe equation for average total cost (ATC) is\n\\[ \\mathsf{ATC = \\frac{C}{Q} = \\frac{f}{Q} + c. } \\]\n\n\nEstimating the Scale Curve: The Power of the Power Function\nWe can see that economies of scale have a compound effect of spreading fixed cost \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{f}{Q}}\\) and increased efficiency reducing unit cost \\(\\mathsf{c(Q)}\\). We tend to estimate how \\(\\mathsf{ATC}\\) changes with \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) using a power function:\n\\[ \\mathsf{ATC = a Q^b}\\] where:\n\n\\(\\mathsf{a}\\) is a constant showing initial cost levels.\n\\(\\mathsf{b}\\) is the parameter, usually a negative number, indicating how quickly costs fall as Q rises. If you’re not math-inclined, think of it as a way to gauge how steeply your costs will decrease as you ramp up production. The steeper the curve, the greater the potential savings.\n\nWe will explore how to estimate the effects of economies of scale in the case of the Liberty Ship in ?sec-liberty.\n\n\nThe Flip Side: Diseconomies of Scale\nBut beware, like a too-big ship that’s hard to steer, growing your business too much, too fast, can lead to higher costs per unit—this is called diseconomies of scale. It could be due to over-complicated management, increased transportation costs, or simply because workers feel lost in a company that’s become too large.\n\n\nThe Sweet Spot: Minimum Efficient Scale (MES)\nMES is where your business operates in the most cost-effective manner. It’s not just about being big; it’s about being the right size in your market. If you’re smaller than MES, you’re not spreading costs effectively. Bigger than MES? You might be facing diseconomies.",

    "section": "9.2 The Learning Curve",
    "text": "9.2 The Learning Curve\nGaining experience in your business operations can lead to a decrease in variable costs, allowing you to get to break-even faster. This experience manifests through the learning curve, which captures how businesses typically get better—and thus, more cost-efficient—at what they do over time.\n\nWhat is the learning curve?\nThe concept of a learning curve is straightforward: the more you produce, the better you get at it, and the less it costs to make each additional item. Specifically, costs tend to drop by a consistent percentage each time your total production doubles.\n\n\nWhy does cost per unit fall with cumulative experience?\nLearning curves stem from numerous improvements as your business matures, such as increased labor productivity, better process control, product enhancements, and increased efficiency across operations. While learning curves are especially relevant in manufacturing and labor-intensive settings, they’re also applicable to startups that are outsourcing in the beginning. As you gain experience and shift towards more in-house production, these benefits become more pronounced.\n\n\nThe Basic Equation(s)\nUsually, the learning curve is characterized by a constant percentage reduction in cost associated with a doubling of production. This is best expressed by the traditional learning curve formula as a power function:\n\\[ \\mathsf{c_{N} = c_{1} \\  N^{b}} \\] where\n\n\\(\\mathsf{c_{N}}\\) is the unit cost to produce the N-th unit – it is a dynamic form of the unit cost \\(\\mathsf{c}\\).\n\\(\\mathsf{c_{1}}\\) is the unit cost to produce the first unit.\n\\(\\mathsf{N}\\) is the total (cumulative) number of units produced so far.\n\\(\\mathsf{b}\\) is the learning parameter, a negative number telling us how quickly costs fall.\n\nLearning curves of this form have the feature that they decrease by a fixed percent every time cumulative experience \\(\\mathsf{N}\\) doubles. For example, if we have an “80 percent learning curve,” it means that with every doubling of total output, the cost per unit drops to 80 percent of what it was prior to the doubling—a 20 percent reduction.\nThe relationship between the learning rate (the percentage of cost that remains after each doubling of experience) and the learning parameter \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) can be calculated with these formulas:\n\\[\n\\mathsf{b = \\frac{log(r)}{log(2)}}\n\\] where \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) is the learning parameter and \\(\\mathsf{r}\\) is the learning rate meaning the percentage of the previous level of cost the learning curve will bring the cost down to. For example, for an 80 percent learning curve, \\(\\mathsf{r = 0.80}\\) so\n\\[\n\\mathsf{b = \\frac{log(0.80)}{log(2)} = -0.3219}\n\\]\nIf we know the learning parameter \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) but not the learning rate \\(\\mathsf{r}\\), we calculate \\(\\mathsf{r}\\) with \\[\n\\mathsf{r = 2^{-b}}\n\\] For an 80 percent learning curve, we know that the learning parameter \\(\\mathsf{b = -0.3219}\\) so\n\\[\n\\mathsf{r = 2^{-0.3219281} = 0.8.}\n\\]\n\n\nLearning Curve in Action\nThe impact of the learning curve is illustrated by how variable costs decrease over time. For a starting variable cost of $100, an 80 percent learning curve shows a drop to $22.71 after 100 units. Figure 9.1 displays these cost paths for 90 percent, 80 percent, and 70 percent learning curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: 90 percent, 80 percent, and 70 percent learning curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing Strategy and the Learning Curve\nSometimes, setting a price below your current unit cost can be strategic if it helps accumulate experience faster, thus reducing costs more quickly. But it’s crucial to accurately understand your learning curve because an overestimate can lead to delayed profitability.",

Let’s look at the cost of having the Dorsal pack manufactured by a contract manufacturer. The manufacturer charges $40 per backpack to be manufactured, packaged, and delivered to the start-up’s offices.

Profitability is not just a financial metric, but a comprehensive indicator of your startup’s health, sustainability, and potential for growth.\nProfitability represents the ability of a business to generate more revenue than it spends in costs. It’s the lifeblood of any venture, determining its viability and long-term success. For entrepreneurs, profitability is not merely a goal; it’s a vital sign of their startup’s effectiveness in creating value and its efficiency in managing resources.\nFor startups, the path to profitability is often challenging yet imperative. It’s a clear indicator to investors and stakeholders of your business’s potential. Profitability demonstrates that your startup is not just an idea but a functional entity capable of sustaining itself and scaling. It reassures that the business model is sound, the market demand is adequately met, and the operational efficiencies are in place.\nThis chapter stands at the confluence of the preceding discussions on demand, revenue, and cost. Here, we weave these elements together to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to calculate and evaluate your startup’s profitability. We will delve into the analytics of profitability, using data-driven insights to make informed decisions.\nYou’ve learned about demand curves, understood revenue streams, and dissected cost structures. Now, it’s time to integrate these concepts. We’ll start with the maximization of profit - identifying the optimal balance between revenue generation and cost management. This section will not only discuss the theoretical aspects but also demonstrate practical analytical methods to derive these insights.\nFollowing this, we will explore how to utilize the optimal pricing strategy, gleaned from profit maximization, to conduct a thorough break-even analysis. This analysis is crucial in understanding at what point your startup stops operating at a loss and starts generating profits.\nRemember, profitability is more than a number; it’s a testament to your startup’s ability to thrive in a competitive landscape. Through this chapter, you will gain the analytical acumen to not just dream of profitability but to strategically plan for it, measure it, and achieve it.",

    "text": "10.2 Rescaling Is Required to Calculate Profit\nThe basic profit equation is\n\\[ \\mathsf{\\pi = PQ - cQ -f} \\] meaning that to calculate profit we need to know price, quantity, variable unit cost, and fixed cost. Price is something you set in your optimization. Quantity is determined by customers’ demand given the choice of price. Variable unit cost \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) and fixed cost \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) are determined by the cost structure chosen to produce the product or service you offer for sale. In short, the earlier chapters in demand, revenue and cost formed the building blocks we need to calculate profit.\nBut there’s a catch: revenue (driven by demand) and cost data often don’t align. Typically, demand data comes from a small sample of customers, while cost data reflects the entire market. Imagine trying to cover the costs of a nationwide campaign with just a local fundraiser’s revenue - it doesn’t add up.\n\nThe Solution: Rescaling\nTo resolve this, we either scale up demand to match market size or scale down fixed costs to the sample size.\n\nScaling up demand: Multiply your sample-based demand by a factor that represents the market size.\nScaling down fixed cost: Adjust the market-level fixed costs to reflect the proportion attributed to your sample size.\n\n\n\nScaling Up Demand\nLet’s say our sample demand curve from 100 respondents is:\n\\[ \\mathsf{Q_{sample} = 327 - 2.19 \\ P.} \\] With a market of 1,000,000,000 potential customers, our sample is just a tiny fraction.

To scale this to our sample size:\nDivide the fixed cost by the scaling factor \\(m\\). Now, your sample’s share of the fixed cost is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{C_{sample}} &= \\mathsf{ \\frac{f_{market} }{m} + c\\ Q} \\\\[8pt]\n                    &= \\mathsf{ \\frac{1\\ 000\\ 000}{100} + 1.5 \\ Q} \\\\[8pt]\n                    &= \\mathsf{ 10\\ 000 + 1.5 \\ Q}\n\\end{align}\\]\nYour sample-level profit equation is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{\\pi_{sample}} =& \\mathsf{\\  P\\ Q_{sample} - f_{sample} - c\\ Q_{sample}} \\\\\n                      =& \\mathsf{\\  P \\ (327 - 2.19 \\ P) - 100 - 1.5 \\ (327 - 2.19 \\ P) }\n\\end{align}\\]\nThrough rescaling, we align our demand data with our cost data, enabling an accurate and realistic profitability analysis.

The essence of profitability lies not just in generating revenue but in outpacing costs, a balance heavily influenced by market competition.\n\nMonopoly Profits and Market Choice\nAs an entrepreneur, the choice of market and problem-solving approach significantly impacts your profitability potential. Ideally, operating as a monopolist, where you’re the sole provider of a unique solution, offers the highest profit margin. However, true monopolies are rare. They represent the upper bound of profitability you can expect to earn, serving as a benchmark for assessing performance in more competitive contexts.\nMonopoly Characteristics:\n\nSingle Firm Dominance: A market with one powerful firm.\nComplete Product Differentiation: No rival products, ensuring complete market control.\nStrong Entry Barriers: Prevent potential competitors from entering the market.\nPowerless Customers: Large customer base with limited individual influence on price.\nPerfect Information: Complete awareness of prices and availability among buyers and sellers.\n\nIn monopoly settings, profit (denoted \\(\\mathsf{\\pi}\\)) is the difference between revenue (\\(\\mathsf{R}\\)) and cost (\\(\\mathsf{C}\\)) with the profit equation \\(\\mathsf{ \\pi = R - C}\\). To illustrate, consider the demand, revenue, and cost functions from earlier chapters:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\mathsf{Q} &= \\mathsf{2000 - 2P} \\\\\n\n\\mathsf{R} &= \\mathsf{2000P - 2P^2} \\\\\n\n\\mathsf{C} &= \\mathsf{50,\\!000 + 200 Q} \\\\\n           &= \\mathsf{450,\\!000 - 400P}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nThese core elements of the profit function yield a final profit function of \\[ \\mathsf{\\pi = 1600 P - 2P^2 - 450,\\!000.} \\] as depicted in Figure 10.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Profit as the difference between revenue and cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing Profit through Optimal Pricing\nThe crux of profit maximization lies in setting the right price. The optimal price is the one that marks the greatest distance between revenue and cost. This is illustrated in Figure 10.2.\n\nRevenue Maximizing Price: At first glance, it might seem logical to aim for the price that maximizes revenue. For example, our analysis shows that at a price of $500, the revenue hits its peak. However, this doesn’t translate to maximum profit. Despite generating a profit of $250,000 at this price, a closer look at Figure 10.2 reveals that we’re not optimizing our profit potential here.\nProfit Maximizing Price: Diving deeper, we discover that the key to maximizing profit lies not in the revenue peak but at a different price point. By adjusting the price to $600, we find the sweet spot where profit is maximized at $270,000. This is a crucial insight for entrepreneurs: the price that maximizes revenue is not the one that maximizes profit.\n\nIn short, the goal is always to find the profit maximizing price. While it might be tempting to chase the highest revenue, it’s the profit that ultimately sustains and grows your business.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Profit earned at the revenue maximizing price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Monopoly: Preparing for Competitive Markets\nWhile our analysis so far assumes a monopolistic setting, most startups eventually face competition. The upcoming chapters delve into oligopoly and game theory, crucial for understanding competitive dynamics. This understanding will further refine our analysis of profitability, accounting for competitor interactions and market responses.",

    "text": "10.4 Break-even Analysis\nA critical task for you as an entrepreneur is to ensure your selling price per unit surpasses your cost per unit. This sounds simple, but it’s nuanced. If your venture has no fixed costs, just ensure your price is above your average variable cost. However, most businesses do face fixed costs, meaning your total revenue over a period must exceed all your costs, including these fixed expenses. Remember, covering fixed costs can take time, and your venture needs sufficient revenue growth to meet these expenses.\nBreak-even analysis helps you determine the break-even quantity - the volume of sales needed to cover all costs without making a profit. Before you reach break-even, you are operating at a loss that you must cover with debt or investor money. After you reach break-even, you can begin paying back the losses you incurred before reaching break-even. Without large amounts of outside funding, it may be necessary to invest in a different cost structure that is more favorable in the short-run even if it leads to higher costs in the long run. If this condition seems unreachable, it’s a red flag for your business model.\n\nCalculating Break-Even Quantity\nThe key to break-even analysis is to determine how many units you must sell to cover your fixed costs in additions to your variable costs. To find this quantity, set your profit function (revenue minus costs) to zero, assuming you know your profit-maximizing price \\(\\mathsf{P^*}\\) . The break-even quantity, denoted as \\(\\mathsf{\\underline{Q}}\\), is then calculated by dividing your fixed costs by the margin (price minus variable cost). The equation is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n          \\mathsf{\\pi} &= \\mathsf{P\\ Q - f - cQ} = 0 \\notag \\\\[8pt]\n\\mathsf{\\underline{Q}} &= \\mathsf{\\dfrac{f}{P^*-c}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhich is, in words, the fixed cost divided by the margin.\n\n\nApplying Break-Even Analysis: A Practical Example\nImagine you estimated a demand curve from a sample of potential customers:\n\\[ \\mathsf{q = 12 - 0.02 \\ p.} \\]\nScaling this demand curve up to your target market size is essential. Let’s say your potential market is 250,000 customers, scaled up from the 50 in your sample. Your adjusted demand curve becomes:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathsf{Q} &= \\mathsf{\\frac{250,\\!000}{50} \\ q} \\\\[8pt]\n           &= \\mathsf{60,\\!000 - 100 P}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nNow, using a specific cost structure:\n\\[ \\mathsf{C = 50,\\!000 - 200Q} \\]\nThis combination of demand and cost curves leads to a profit-maximizing price of \\(\\mathsf{P^* = \\$400}\\) and maximized profit at that price is \\(\\mathsf{\\pi = \\$3,\\!950,\\!000}\\). With the demand curve, cost curve, and profit maximizing price, break-even quantity is a simple calculation.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{\\underline{Q}} &= \\mathsf{\\frac{f}{P^*\\! - c} = \\frac{50,\\!000}{400 - 200} } \\\\[8pt]\n                       &= \\mathsf{\\frac{50,\\!000}{200} }\\\\[8pt]\n                       &= \\mathsf{250}.\n\\end{align}\\]\nBefore this startup is able to reliably sell 250 units, it is operating at a loss. Every unit of quantity above 250 generates positive profit.\nThe relationship between revenue, cost, and break-even quantity is illustrated in Figure 10.3.\n\n###  Break even quantity\nf &lt;- 50000\nc &lt;- 200\n\nfTC &lt;- function(Q) f + c*Q\nfF &lt;- function(Q) f \n\nPstar &lt;- 400\nfR &lt;- function(Q) Pstar * Q \n\nrev_bounds &lt;- tibble(x = c(0, 500))    # Create tibble containing plot range for x-axis (P)\neqn1 &lt;- \" R = P Q = 400 Q\"\neqn2 &lt;- \" C = 50,000 + 200 Q \"\neqn3 &lt;- \" underline(Q) == 250 \"\neqn4 &lt;- \" f = 50,000 \"\nggplot(rev_bounds, aes(x)) +                     # Draw ggplot2 plot\n  #\n  \n  #\n  geom_function(fun = fF, color = \"#FA7240\", linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_function(fun = fTC, color = \"#DA0406\", linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_function(fun = fR, color = \"RoyalBlue\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(#title = \"Revenue for a ticket to a dollar theater\",\n    x = \"Quantity\",\n    y = \"Revenue and Cost\") +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=360, y=170000, label=\"Revenue\", hjust = 1, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=360, y=158000, label=eqn1, hjust = 1, size = 3, parse=F) +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=450, y=120000, label=\"Total Cost\", hjust = 0.5, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=450, y=108000, label=eqn2, hjust = 0.5, size = 3, parse=F) +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=260, y=18000, label=\"Break-even Quantity\", hjust = 0, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=260, y=6000, label=eqn3, hjust = 0, size = 3, parse=TRUE) +\n  #\n  geom_text(x=400, y=68000, label=\"Fixed Cost\", hjust = 0.5, size = 4, parse=F) +\n  geom_text(x=400, y=56000, label=eqn4, hjust = 0.5, size = 3, parse=F) +\n  #\n  #scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  scale_y_continuous(lim = c(-0,200000), labels=scales::dollar_format()) + \n  theme_hc() + # base size = 12, font family = sans, ... \n  #  scale_color_brewer(palette=\"GnBu\", direction=-1) +\n  theme(legend.justification=c(0, 1), legend.position=c(1.8, 1)) # hides legend outside the frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Break-even quantity where revenue equals cost and positive profits begin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak-even Quantity and Time Determine Your Funding Needs\nThe relationship between revenue, cost, and break-even quantity, illustrated in Figure 10.3 tells you the scale needed for profitability. However, it doesn’t indicate the time required to reach this scale, which depends on sales growth. Depending on demand, you may expect to sell 250 units every hour or it may take more than a year to sell that many units.\nYou should estimate how long you think it will take for your sales to reach the break-even quantity based on your demand curve and your early growth rate. That estimate will guide you in how much money you will need from outside sources for your venture to reach profitability. Estimate how much time it’ll take for your sales to reach the break-even quantity. This will guide your funding needs to sustain the venture until it becomes profitable.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of Cost Structure\nBreak-even analysis isn’t just a mathematical exercise; it’s a strategic tool. It guides your decisions on cost structures and underscores the importance of understanding your market and sales potential. Different cost structures lead to different break-even points and, by extension, different funding requirements. This is detailed in Table 10.1. Observe how changes in fixed and variable costs influence the break-even quantity, shaping your strategic decisions.\n\n# Creating the data frame\ncost_structures &lt;- data.frame(\n  Cost_Structure = c(1, 2, 3),\n  Fixed_Cost = c(\"$5000\", \"$50,000\", \"$500,000\"),\n  Variable_Cost = c(\"$300\", \"$200\", \"$100\"),\n  Profit_Maximizing_Price = c(\"$450\", \"$400\", \"$350\"),\n  Break_Even_Quantity = c(33.33, 250, 2000)  # Retaining as numeric\n)\n\n# Creating and styling the gt table\ngt(cost_structures) %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    Cost_Structure = \"Cost Structure\",\n    Fixed_Cost = \"Fixed Cost\",\n    Variable_Cost = \"Variable Cost\",\n    Profit_Maximizing_Price = \"Profit-maximizing Price\",\n    Break_Even_Quantity = \"Break-even Quantity\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = Break_Even_Quantity,\n    decimals = 2,\n    drop_trailing_zeros = TRUE\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align_decimal() %&gt;% \n  tab_options(\n    column_labels.font.size = \"large\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost Structure\nFixed Cost\nVariable Cost\nProfit-maximizing Price\nBreak-even Quantity\n\n\n\n\n1 \n$5000\n$300\n$450\n   33.33\n\n\n2 \n$50,000\n$200\n$400\n  250   \n\n\n3 \n$500,000\n$100\n$350\n2,000   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Impact of changing cost structure on break-even quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Launching a No-Frills Car Brand\n The Modern Automobile: A Technology Showcase\nIn today’s world, cars are not just about transportation; they’re marvels of technology. Imagine the latest models with their array of features: airbags, anti-lock brakes, anti-theft systems, and a suite of automated systems like GPS, on-board WIFI, and self-driving capabilities. Initially, these features are exclusive to luxury cars due to their high development costs. But as technology evolves, even entry-level cars start boasting these sophisticated systems. By 2016, electronics constitute a third of a car’s cost, a significant price bump passed on to consumers. For tech enthusiasts, this is a bargain; for those seeking basic transportation, it’s a steep price to pay.\nThe Market Gap: Simplicity in Complexity\nAmidst this tech escalation, there’s a gap: what about consumers who want simple, affordable cars? This overlooked segment could represent a unique entrepreneurial opportunity. What if you could start a company focused on building basic, low-tech cars? Let’s dive into the financial feasibility of this idea.\nThe Cost of Car-Making\nDeveloping a new car platform is a costly affair, typically ranging from $700 million to $2 billion. Our approach, eschewing expensive tech, might reduce these costs. Let’s estimate a development cost of $500 million, allocated to design, engineering, and factory retooling. The big automakers average a $2500 profit per car, but for smaller, simpler cars, this margin might shrink to $2000. To break even, you’d need to sell a quarter of a million cars - a daunting target.\nReality Check: The Sales Challenge\nIn 2015, the U.S. car market saw record-breaking sales of 1.7 million cars. But how realistic is our target of 250,000 cars? Comparing with smaller, established brands like Buick, Acura, or Land Rover offers perspective. These brands sold hundreds of thousands of cars annually, but a new brand like ours would likely start much smaller. Tesla, a relatively new entrant, sold only 22,800 cars in 2015. At that rate, it would take over a decade to recover the development costs.\nThe High Stakes of High Fixed Costs\nThe auto industry’s high fixed-cost structure presents a formidable barrier to new entrants, especially at the low-end market. Tesla’s success comes from catering to an affluent customer base, offering high-tech cars at premium prices. Our proposed venture sits at the opposite end: targeting cost-conscious consumers with simpler, cheaper vehicles. The challenge is immense: attract enough buyers willing to trade tech for savings and achieve the massive sales volume needed to cover the fixed costs.\nThe Verdict: A Tough Road Ahead\nIn conclusion, breaking into the auto industry at the low end poses significant risks. The sheer volume of sales needed to cover fixed costs is daunting, and the competitive landscape is unforgiving. Any entrepreneur eyeing this opportunity must carefully weigh these factors against the potential of tapping into an underserved market.",

This stylish, modern backpack has zippers facing inward, toward the back of the wearer, for security. For added security, it is made of slash-resistant fabric in nondescript colors to avoid the attention that more colorful, fashion-oriented brands draw.\nThe team validated the problem and solution, refined the concept, and confirmed direct sales through their website. They conducted a profitability analysis with 107 potential customers, who rated the innovation, suggested improvements, stated their maximum willingness to pay, and provided travel and demographic information.\n\n\nDorsal Pack data\nInitially, the team reached out to members of their social networks and invited those who had recently traveled or were planning to travel in the near future to help. They were able to get 112 responses from potential customers who had traveled or were about to travel.\n\nDemand and Revenue\nThe respondents were shown the backpack and its features. They were asked to rate the innovation and offer suggestions to improve it. They were also asked “What is the most you would be willing to pay for the Dorsal travel pack?” Finally, they provided information about their travel patterns as well as demographics. Because the travel pack is a durable good for most travelers, they focused on the of willingness to pay from respondents who had traveled or were planning to travel soon. We see the following responses:\n\ndp &lt;- tibble(wtp = c(64, 18, 46, 92, 110, 138, 113, 89, 0, 258, 205, 0, 18, 202, 46, 258, 0, 141, 0, 46, 61, 101, 64, 215, 95, 43, 46, 46, 132, 21, 18, 113, 9, 18, 21, 18, 104, 6, 0, 101, 6, 224, 322, 18, 316, 156, 104, 322, 285, 208, 316, 0, 288, 95, 6, 52, 46, 0, 18, 64, 98, 248, 18, 110, 0, 67, 0, 18, 0, 89, 132, 101, 18, 215, 18, 0, 0, 104, 285, 3, 46, 141, 322, 291, 89, 0, 101, 113, 67, 58, 132, 215, 224, 291, 9, 291, 267, 6, 6, 61, 178, 285, 64, 126, 0, 101, 15))\n\n# inspect the data\nglimpse(dp)\n\nRows: 107\nColumns: 1\n$ wtp &lt;dbl&gt; 64, 18, 46, 92, 110, 138, 113, 89, 0, 258, 205, 0, 18, 202, 46, 25…\n\n\n\n\nCost Structure\nDorsal plans to have the pack manufactured by a contract manufacturer who charges $40 per backpack to be manufactured, packaged, and delivered to the startup’s offices. The startup is also spending $200 per month for web hosting and $5500 per month for contracted web development. Their total cost curve is linear: \\(\\mathsf{C = cQ + f}\\) where \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) is the variable cost per unit and \\(\\mathsf{f}\\) is fixed cost per month.\n\n\nRescaling\nTo conduct profitability analytics, it’s crucial to align the scale of sample demand with the fixed costs required to serve the market. For this analysis, we will rescale the demand up to the market level. Concerning market size:\n\nInternational Travelers from the U.S.: According to the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office, approximately 93 million international trips were made by U.S. citizens in 2019. We focus on 2019 data because international travel dynamics significantly changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent recovery data is not yet fully available.\n\nWe estimate that the average international traveler makes about 1.5 trips per year, accounting for both frequent travelers and those who rarely travel abroad.\nIt is generally estimated that 70 to 80 percent of these trips are for leisure purposes.\nCombining these factors, we assume there were approximately 43.4 million unique international travelers in 2019.\n\nPercentage of Young Travelers Likely to Use a Backpack: While detailed data is unavailable, a conservative estimate suggests that 25% of these travelers are in the 20-39 age group, a demographic typically more active in international travel. This estimation brings our target population down to 10.85 million.\nInterest in Security: Estimating the proportion interested in security-enhanced travel gear is challenging. However, considering increased travel safety awareness, we assume that around 20% of the travelers in this age group might be interested in a more secure backpack. This further narrows our target population to approximately 2.17 million.\nMarket share in a crowded backpack market: Recognizing the diverse needs and preferences of travelers, as well as the crowded nature of the backpack market, achieving a 1-5% market share would be substantial. Opting for a midpoint estimate of 3%, we approximate the target market to be around 65,100 potential customers.\n\nIn summary, our assumption for the target market is about 65,100 potential travelers, and the Dorsal team has sampled data from 112 individuals within this segment for their analysis.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat is the rescaling factor \\(\\mathsf{m}\\) based on the calculation of the target population?\nHow many backpacks would you expect to sell to the sample of 107 respondents at a price of $110?\nHow many backpacks would you expect to sell to the complete market at a price of $110?\nWhat is the fixed cost?\nWhat is the unit variable cost?\nWhat is the profit maximizing price for a Dorsal pack? Use the rescaled market demand curve for your calculation and continue to use the market demand for the rest of the questions.\nWhat is the quantity of travel packs sold at the profit maximizing price?\nWhat is the revenue earned by selling Dorsal packs at the profit maximizing price?\nWhat is the profit earned by selling Dorsal packs at the profit maximizing price?\nWhat is the difference between the profit maximizing price and the revenue maximizing price for Dorsal packs? Specifically calculate this as \\(\\mathsf{P^*_{\\pi_{max}} - P^*_{R_{max}}}\\).\nWhat is the difference between the revenue when charging the profit maximizing price and the revenue when charging the revenue maximizing price for Dorsal packs? Specifically, calculate this as \\(\\mathsf{R^*_{\\pi_{max}} - R^*_{R_{max}}}\\).\nWhat is the difference between the profit when charging the profit maximizing price and the profit when charging the revenue maximizing price for Dorsal packs. Specifically, calculate this as \\(\\mathsf{\\pi^*_{\\pi_{max}} - \\pi^*_{R_{max}}}\\).\nShould the Dorsal pack team charge the profit maximizing price or the revenue maximizing price? Choose the best price and un-comment it.\n\nbest_price &lt;- “They should charge the profit maximizing price.”\nbest_price &lt;- “They should charge the revenue maximizing price.”\n\nThe Dorsal pack team is seeking funding from investors and wants to be able to communicate how long it will need investor funding to reach profitability.

    "text": "11.1 Competitive Extremes: Monopoly vs. Perfect Competition\nCompetition is fundamentally about contending with rivals to capture and retain customers. This contest is not merely a battle for market share; it is a critical determinant of a company’s overall performance and long-term viability. The demand a business creates with its product or service defines its ability to attract and keep customers.\nAt its core, competition in business is a zero-sum game for customers—every customer won by one firm is a loss for another. However, the real battleground is profitability. Successful firms don’t just capture customers; they find ways to keep them while maximizing profit.\nTo understand competition effectively, we must go beyond simple textbook models. Real-world firms rarely operate in pure monopoly or perfect competition. Instead, most businesses compete in an oligopoly, where a few firms shape the market and respond strategically to each other. This chapter explores what that means for entrepreneurs and why Bertrand competition—where firms compete on price—is the most relevant model for startups and growth-stage companies.",

    "text": "Entrepreneurs Dream of Monopoly, but It Rarely Lasts\nA monopoly is the ideal scenario for a business: one firm controls the market, sets its own prices, and faces no direct competition. Peter Thiel (2014) famously encourages entrepreneurs to seek monopolistic positions, using innovation, branding, and market dominance to insulate themselves from competition.\nHowever, true monopolies are exceedingly rare. Even when firms create something new, competitors follow.\n\nGoogle may dominate search with over 90 percent market share worldwide, but it still has competitors like Bing and DuckDuckGo.\nTesla once had a near monopoly Tesla once had a monopoly on the EV market, but competitors quickly emerged. By 2024, Tesla’s U.S. market share dropped below 60% as legacy automakers introduced their own EV models.\n\nEven when you create a new market, competition will follow.\nFor most startups, a lasting monopoly is a pipe dream. The real challenge is navigating competition in oligopolistic markets, where rivals react to every move.\n\n\nEntrepreneurs in Perfect Competition Are Living a Nightmare\nAt the other extreme, perfect competition describes markets with many small firms selling identical products—think of small farmers selling wheat or corn. In this setting, no firm has pricing power, and competition between firms drives profits to their minimum.\nMany Amazon E-commerce third-party sellers offer the exact same products as their rivals and undercut each other on price, leading to razor-thin margins. As long as they continue to sell the same things as other sellers, there is no way to grow margins and profit.\nFor an entrepreneur, perfect competition is a death trap. If you enter a market where everyone sells the same thing at the same price, you have no control over your business. While it’s crucial to understand the dynamics of perfect competition, as an entrepreneur, steering clear of such markets is advisable.\n\n🔎 For a deeper dive into why perfect competition leads to low profits, see the supplementary document on perfect competition.\n\n\n\nAlert Entrepreneurs Compete in the Reality of Oligopoly\nMost entrepreneurs find themselves in oligopoly markets, where a small number of firms dominate and strategic interactions matter. Unlike perfect competition, businesses in an oligopoly can influence prices, differentiate products, and shape consumer choices.1\n\nApple may appear to behave as a monopoly, charging $1,200 for an iPhone while rivals like Samsung and Google offer similar specs for less. But customers have choices, and Apple continuously innovates to differentiate the iPhone experience to justify its prices compared to rivals. Its differentiation—brand prestige, ecosystem lock-in, and design—gives it pricing power, but competition is always lurking.\nMany luxury brands create the illusion of monopoly, but they still compete against alternatives (e.g., Omega vs. Rolex, Lamborghini vs. Ferrari).\n\nOligopoly is the competitive reality for startups. Even if you begin with a new, innovative product, competitors will emerge. Success depends on understanding how to compete strategically, whether through pricing, differentiation, branding, or innovation.",

    "text": "11.2 Monopolistic Competition: The Comforting Illusion\nMany businesses behave as if they are monopolists, setting prices and strategies without paying much attention to competitors. This mindset is encouraged by monopolistic competition, an economic framework where firms assume they have pricing power due to product differentiation.\nHowever, competition still exists and matters. Even if a business thinks it has a monopoly, customers are aware of alternatives, and rivals will react.\nIn the previous book part on Profit, we explored demand, revenue, costs, and break-even analysis—implicitly assuming monopoly conditions. That assumption holds in cases where:\n1. A firm has created a temporary monopoly through innovation or branding.\n2. Customers perceive a product as unique enough to justify higher prices.\n3. Competitors are too weak or inattentive to respond effectively.\nBut this illusion is short-lived. Most entrepreneurs quickly find themselves in an oligopoly, where competitors fight for market share, and pricing power is limited.\nThe Takeaway: Entrepreneurs should use monopolistic competition thinking as a tool for differentiation, not as an excuse to ignore competition. The more a firm assumes it has monopoly power, the more vulnerable it is to being blindsided by real competitors.",

    "text": "11.3 The Realities of Competing on Price\n\nAvoid the Quicksand of Price Competition\nSuccessful companies continuously strategize to captivate their target customers. One common approach is enhancing product value through innovation and effective branding. However, a more direct and often perilous route is through price competition—lowering prices to divert customers from competitors. This method, while immediately impactful, can trigger a chain reaction of price matching or undercutting by competitors, culminating in a harmful price war. The more they compete, the further they sink into price wars. Such wars often result in selling similar quantities but at continually decreasing prices, eroding profits for all involved.\n\n\nThe Inevitability of Competing on Price\nDespite the evident risks of price competition, it’s crucial to acknowledge a fundamental truth: all firms, in one way or another, compete on price. The pricing decisions made by businesses significantly influence customer purchasing choices, thus determining the demand for their products. Price considerations remain paramount even when a company’s focus is on non-price factors like product features or brand allure. The challenge lies in strategically setting prices that optimize profit without igniting a price war.\n\n\nExtend Strategic Focus to Pricing and Beyond\nOur goal is to master the art of competing effectively while not solely relying on price. This requires a keen understanding of oligopoly markets, particularly in contexts where the temptation to engage in price battles is strongest. We delve into the concept of undifferentiated Bertrand oligopoly, where the allure and risks of pure price competition loom large, and contrast it with differentiated Bertrand oligopoly. In the latter, product differentiation plays a pivotal role, offering avenues to sidestep a battle centered only on price.\n\n\nDiverse Customers Prefer Diverse Products over Lower Prices\nThe idea that a race to the lowest price benefits customers seems appealing, especially in markets with undifferentiated products. It suggests a scenario where everyone gets exactly what they want at the lowest possible price. However, this notion overlooks a critical aspect of consumer behavior: heterogeneity in customer preferences. Customers often seek varied products that cater specifically to their unique needs. In such a diverse marketplace, the lowest price for a one-size-fits-all product is rarely the most attractive option. This is true even in segments with limited incomes, where the demand for variety and specificity remains robust. Therefore, a market thriving on serving customer diversity often trumps one racing to the bottom in pricing, especially in meeting the nuanced needs of a varied customer base.",

In many industries, firms offer nearly identical products and find themselves competing on price alone. This is the essence of undifferentiated Bertrand competition—a brutal pricing battle where firms repeatedly undercut each other until profit margins are razor-thin.\nFor entrepreneurs, understanding undifferentiated Bertrand competition is critical for two reasons: 1. It explains why competing on price alone is dangerous. If you enter a market where customers see no difference between products, price wars will push profits toward zero. 2. It highlights strategic ways to escape the price-cutting trap. Entrepreneurs who manage costs better, leverage capacity constraints, or find creative pricing strategies can still carve out profitable opportunities.\nThis chapter examines the dynamics of undifferentiated Bertrand oligopoly, why price wars happen, and what strategies can help entrepreneurs avoid the race to the bottom.",

    "text": "12.3 Price Wars Are Rational but Mutually Destructive\nImagine a market with just two firms (a duopoly) where products and costs are identical. When one firm sets a price, the other has three options: match it, price higher, or undercut it. The logical move is to undercut, capturing the entire market at a slightly reduced price. This, however, prompts the first firm to respond with its own price cut to regain the market, leading to a continuous undercutting cycle.\nThis strategic price reduction leads to a price war, with both firms lowering their prices in tandem. Equilibrium is eventually reached when prices fall to the leveo of costs. At this point, lowering prices further would mean operating at a loss, so no incentive remains for either firm to change their pricing strategy. This situation, where firms end up earning zero economic profit, represents the epitome of fierce price competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Profit vs. Accounting Profit\n\n\n\nZero economic profit doesn’t imply the absence of accounting profit. It means the business is viable—it covers all expenses and compensates for the entrepreneur’s time and capital—but doesn’t generate surplus profits beyond what could be earned elsewhere with the same investment of time and resources.\n\n\nThe equilibrium where a firm’s best response is to set price equal to cost is competition at its worst.1 It highlights the need to avoid competing solely on prices.

    "section": "12.4 Strategies to Avoid the Price War Trap",
    "text": "12.4 Strategies to Avoid the Price War Trap\n\nGaining a Cost Advantage\nOne effective strategy to steer clear of price wars in undifferentiated Bertrand competition is to establish a cost advantage. Consider firms with varying costs due to different technologies. The firm with the lowest marginal cost (Firm 1) and the next lowest (Firm 2) set the stage for market dynamics.\n\nMarket Dynamics with Varied Costs: When the market price equates to the cost of the higher-cost firm, that firm can’t gain by reducing its price. However, the lower-cost firm (Firm 1) continues to have the incentive to undercut. This process drives the higher-cost firm out of the market, with the price cutting halting at the cost level of Firm 2.\nPosition of the Lowest-Cost Firm: Firm 1, with the lowest cost, doesn’t become a monopolist but instead dominates the market share, constrained by the cost structure of its closest competitor (Firm 2). Its pricing power is limited, capping just below the cost of Firm 2.\n\n\n\nExploiting Capacity Constraints\nTypically, in undifferentiated Bertrand oligopolies, it’s assumed that firms can satisfy total market demand at the lowest price. However, adding capacity constraints changes this assumption and the resultant market behavior. Firms can only sell as much as they can produce, even if they offer the lowest price, altering the usual trajectory of a price war and offering some protection against it.\n\n\nDemonstrative Example: Capacity Constraints in Action\n\nSetting the Market Scene\nImagine a scenario in a market where no single firm can satisfy more than 40% of the total demand at the equilibrium price. In such a setup, a minimum of three firms is necessary to fully meet market demand. Let’s consider three firms with the following variable costs:\n\nFirm 1’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_1 = \\$10}\\)\nFirm 2’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_2 = \\$20}\\)\nFirm 3’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_3 = \\$30}\\)\n\n\nMarket Dynamics and Pricing\nIn this market structure, the pricing will stabilize at \\(\\mathsf{\\$30}\\), aligning with the highest variable unit cost among the firms. Here’s how the market share gets distributed: Firms 1 and 2, with their cost advantages, capture 40% of the market each and Firm 3, with the highest cost, caters to the remaining 20%.\n\nFirm 1’s market share: 40% of the market\nFirm 2’s market share: 40% of the market\nFirm 3’s market share: 20% of the market\n\nWhen Firm 3 attempts to expand its market share beyond this 20%, Firms 1 and 2 have the leeway to reduce their prices below \\(\\mathsf{\\$30}\\). Their lower costs enable them to do so while maintaining profitability. As a result, Firm 3, operating at the brink of its cost, can only break even and finds itself unable to compete with the lowered prices.\n\n\n\nImpact of a New Entrant\nNow, introduce a twist in the market with the entry of Firm 4, which has a marginal cost of \\(\\mathsf{\\$25}\\). This new competitive dynamic would push the market price down to \\(\\mathsf{\\$25,}\\) effectively ousting Firm 3 from the market. Firms 1 and 2, despite experiencing a dip in their profits due to the new lower market price, remain profitable. Firm 4, with its cost aligning with the new market price, manages to break even and captures the market share previously held by Firm 3.\n\n\nStrategic Implications\nThis example highlights how capacity constraints and varying cost structures among firms can significantly influence market pricing and distribution of market shares. It illustrates the strategic complexity in an undifferentiated Bertrand oligopoly and underscores the importance of cost management and capacity considerations in competitive positioning.\n\n\n\nMini-mills in the Steel Industry: A Case Study in Undifferentiated Bertrand Competition\nThe emergence of mini-mills in steel production offers a compelling illustration of the dynamics of an undifferentiated Bertrand oligopoly, particularly in the context of heterogeneous variable costs and capacity constraints.\n\nInnovation and Cost Advantage\nMini-mills, an innovative approach to steel production, utilize scrap metal as their primary raw material, contrasting with the traditional integrated steel mills that begin with iron ore. The mini-mills’ process, which starts with already-refined metal, grants them a significant cost advantage over integrated mills. This advantage becomes pronounced in the production of lower-end steel products, such as rebar for construction.\n\n\nMarket Dynamics and Price Impact\nAs mini-mills proliferated, they systematically undercut the integrated mills in the rebar market, leveraging their lower costs. This competitive pressure gradually forced the integrated mills to retreat from this segment. Following their exit, rebar prices experienced a notable 20% decline, equal to the cost advantage of the mini-mills. This pattern—a period of stable prices disrupted by the entry of low-cost innovations and subsequent exit of higher-cost incumbents—consistently resulted in price collapses, aligning with the cost level of the most efficient mini-mills.2\n\n\nThe Commodity Nature of Steel and Market Evolution\nSteel, being a commodity product, exhibits minimal differentiation within each category. Initially, the presence of low-cost mini-mills prompted a shift in market pricing to the level of the highest-cost integrated mills. The mini-mills, with their limited capacity, were able to fill their production to the brim, leaving the remainder of the market demand to the integrated mills.\nHowever, as more mini-mills entered the market, attracted by the potential profits, they brought additional capacity. This increasing capacity from low-cost producers gradually diminished the market share of the higher-cost incumbents. Once the collective capacity of the mini-mills was sufficient to meet market demand, the integrated mills found themselves redundant and exited the market. Subsequently, the price plummeted to the level of the costliest mini-mill.\n\n\nConclusion: The Bertrand Trap for Mini-mills\nThe mini-mills initially enjoyed attractive profits when their capacity was insufficient to meet total market demand. Yet, as their capacity expanded and their costs converged, they found themselves in a classic undifferentiated Bertrand competition scenario. With similar cost structures, the mini-mills faced intense price competition, leading to the inevitable outcome of such markets: prices equalizing to marginal costs and the erosion of extraordinary profits.",

    "text": "12.5 Quantitative Case: Drop-Shipping\n\nBackground\nIn the dynamic e-commerce landscape, drop-shipping has become a common business model. Companies partner with manufacturers, often in China, to sell products on platforms like Amazon or Shopify. The products are shipped directly from the manufacturer to the customer upon order. This model, while efficient, often leads to intense price competition, especially for undifferentiated products.\n\n\nWith different costs\n\nScenario\nImagine a drop-shipping market with four companies: QuickShip, SpeedyDelivery, FastDrop, and RapidSend. They all sell a similar, popular gadget but have different cost structures due to varying agreements with manufacturers.\n\nMarket Demand: The daily market demand for the gadget is given by \\(\\mathsf{Q=1600−5P}\\), where \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) is the quantity of gadgets and \\(\\mathsf{P}\\) is the selling price.\nCost Structures:\n\n\n\nCompany\nFixed Cost (per day)\nVariable Cost (per unit)\n\n\n\n\nQuickShip\n\\$2000\n\\$60\n\n\nSpeedyDelivery\n\\$2200\n\\$50\n\n\nFastDrop\n\\$2800\n\\$35\n\n\nRapidSend\n\\$3000\n\\$25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive Dynamics\nIn this highly competitive market, companies will undercut each other’s prices. RapidSend, with the lowest variable cost of $25, can profitably offer the gadget at lower prices than competitors. To maximize profits, RapidSend will set a price just low enough to out-compete SpeedyDelivery, the next cheapest competitor.\n\nOptimal Pricing: RapidSend sets the price at $34, undercutting SpeedyDelivery. At this price, RapidSend becomes the sole supplier in the market.\nDemand and Profit Calculation:\n\nAt a price of $34, daily demand is \\(\\mathsf{Q = 1600 − 5 \\cdot 34 = 1430}\\) units.\nRapidSend’s daily profit is \\[\\begin{align}\n\n  \\mathsf{\\pi} &= \\mathsf{(P − c) Q − f} \\\\\n               &= \\mathsf{(34 − 25) \\cdot 1430 − 3000} \\\\\n               &= \\mathsf{\\$9870}.\n  \\end{align}\\]\nQuickShip’s daily profit is $0 if they have not yet entered and can avoid their fixed costs and -$2000 if they have already entered.\nSpeedyDelivery’s daily profit is $0 if they have not yet entered and -$2200 if they have.\nFastDrop’s daily profit is $0 if they have not yet entered and and -$2800 if they have.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith capacity constraints and different costs\n\nScenario\nSuppose each company can only handle a maximum of 390 orders per day. Their cost structures are unchanged from above.\n\n\nCompetitive Dynamics\nWith this capacity constraint, the market dynamics change.\n\nMarket Structure: The market can accommodate up to four firms, with each firm having a maximum capacity of 390 units. Three firms will sell at their capacity of 390 with the fourth selling enough to cover the rest of demand at the equilibrium price.\nEquilibrium Price: The price will adjust to a level where four firms can operate profitably in the market – at the highest-cost firm’s variable unit cost ($60).\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis case demonstrates the competitive nature of drop-shipping in an undifferentiated Bertrand market. The key takeaway is the importance of cost management and capacity constraints in determining market dynamics and profitability. Drop-shipping companies often must navigate intense price competition, where having a cost advantage is crucial for survival and profitability.",

    "text": "12.6 Low Price Guarantees\nSo far, the methods for avoiding price competition have had more to do with variable cost and fixed cost (capacity) than with pricing. Low-price guarantees represent a pricing strategy aimed at avoiding constant price wars.\n\nThe Idea Behind Low-Price Guarantees\nLow-price guarantees are promises made to customers that a firm will match or beat the prices of its competitors. While appearing as a customer-centric approach, these guarantees can actually serve as a strategic tool for the firms themselves.\n\n\nImpact on Price Competition\nIn a typical Bertrand scenario, a small price cut by one firm can lead to it capturing the entire market. This triggers a race to the bottom, with firms continually undercutting each other. However, with a low-price guarantee in place, this dynamic changes:\n\nDeterrent to Undercutting: If a competitor lowers its price, the firm with the guarantee can simply match it, retaining its customers. The competing firm gains no additional market share but suffers a reduction in revenue, removing the incentive to undercut prices.3\nMaintaining Prices Above Cost: These guarantees can help maintain prices at a level above cost, benefiting the firms more than their customers.\n\n\n\nWhy Aren’t Low-Price Guarantees Universal?\nDespite their theoretical effectiveness, low-price guarantees are not universally adopted. The reasons include:\n\nLimited Effectiveness in Differentiated Markets: Firms engaged in differentiated competition find these guarantees less effective and necessary.\nCustomer Hassle Factor: The onus is often on the customer to claim the guarantee, which can be a hassle. Not all customers will go through the process, reducing the effectiveness of the guarantee.\nBranding Over Deterrence: Recent studies suggest that low-price guarantees are often used more for branding and advertising than as a genuine pricing strategy.\n\nWhile low-price guarantees offer some respite from relentless price competition, they are not foolproof. A more sustainable approach for entrepreneurs is to identify a niche market with unmet needs and innovate to provide differentiated solutions. Catering to a heterogeneous group of customers with unique demands can be a more effective path to profitability than relying on pricing strategies alone in an undifferentiated market.",

For instance, consider two firms offering similar but distinct products, each enjoying its own loyal customer base. A scenario where one firm offers its product for free doesn’t automatically mean the other loses all its customers. Brand loyalty and product preferences ensure that some customers remain willing to pay a premium.\nIn this market, firms lose the typical price war incentives seen in undifferentiated scenarios. Unique product attributes allow firms to adjust their pricing strategies flexibly. If one firm raises its price, its competitor might also increase its price, potentially adding a premium for its distinct features. This pricing interplay continues until reaching a threshold where customers no longer perceive additional value in paying a higher price.",

    "text": "13.3 Differentiated Bertrand Equilibrium\nIn differentiated Bertrand oligopolies, products are distinct yet substitutable, catering to the diverse needs of heterogeneous customers. This scenario is typical in industries where strategic pricing and product uniqueness play pivotal roles.\n\nDemand Curves for Differentiated Products\nHere, the customer’s perception of products directly influences demand. The general demand equations for two competing firms in such a market can be expressed as:\n\nFirm 1: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{Q_1 = a_1 + b_1 P_1 + b_{12}P_2}\\)\nFirm 2: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{Q_2 = a_2 + b_2 P_2 + b_{21}P_1}\\)\n\nIn these equations, \\(\\mathsf{Q_1}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{Q_2}\\) denote the demand for Firm 1 and Firm 2, respectively, while \\(\\mathsf{P_1}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{P_2}\\) are their corresponding prices. The coefficients \\(\\mathsf{a_1}\\), \\(\\mathsf{b_1}\\), and \\(\\mathsf{b_{12}}\\) (and their Firm 2 counterparts) represent the demand intercept, slope, and cross-price effect, illustrating how each firm’s demand is affected by both its own and its competitor’s pricing.\n\n\nMaximizing Profits with Differentiation\nProfit maximization for each firm involves finding the optimal price that balances revenue and costs. The profit functions are:\n\nFirm 1: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{\\pi_{1} = P_{1}Q_{1} - f_{1} - c_{1}Q_{1}}\\)\nFirm 2: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{\\pi_{2} = P_{2}Q_{2} - f_{2} - c_{2}Q_{2}}\\)\n\nWhere \\(\\mathsf{\\pi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{\\pi_{2}}\\) represent the profits, incorporating both fixed (\\(\\mathsf{f}\\)) and variable unit costs (\\(\\mathsf{c}\\)). Substituting the demand equations into the profit functions, we get:\n\nFirm 1: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{\\pi_1 = P_{1}(a_{1} - b_{1}P_{1}+b_{12}P_{2}) - f_{1} - c_{1}(a_{1} - b_{1}P_{1}+b_{12}P_{2})}\\).\nFirm 2: \\(\\quad \\mathsf{\\pi_2 = P_{2}(a_{2} - b_{2}P_{2}+b_{21}P_{1}) - f_{2} - c_{2}(a_{2} - b_{2}P_{2}+b_{21}P_{1}) }\\).\n\n\n\nReaction Functions\nEach differentiated Bertrand oligopolist’s pricing decision is intertwined with its competitor’s pricing strategy. The relationship between the company’s optimal price and the competitor’s price is captured in reaction functions which map out the optimal pricing response to every possible competitor price.\nFirm 1’s Reaction: Illustrated in Fig. R1, showing how its optimal price adjusts in response to Firm 2’s pricing. Firm 2’s Reaction: Similarly, Firm 2’s optimal pricing, in response to Firm 1’s strategy, is also defined by a reaction function.\nCompany 1’s reaction function showing how its optimal price adjusts in response to Firm 2’s pricing is illustrated in Figure 13.1. The intercept shows that if Company 2 sets price at zero, Company 1 would still set its price above zero. The slope shows that Company 1 will optimally raise its price when Company 2 raises its price. In short, this reaction function demonstrates that each firm’s optimal price is a strategic response to its competitor’s pricing, leading to a state of mutual dependency. For Company 1, the only remaining question is “what price will Company 2 choose?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Reaction function for Company 1 – Company 1’s optimal prices as its best response to every possible price from Company 2\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might already be anticipating that Company 2, much like Company 1, has its own reaction function, dependent on the pricing decisions of Company 1. This interdependence raises an intriguing question: “What price will Company 1 choose?” Logically, we are left with a strategic stalemate with both companies waiting for their competitor act so they can respond with their best price. Fortunately, there is a simple solution to the mutually dependent pricing conundrum.\nFigure 13.2 introduces the reaction function of Company 2 alongside that of Company 1, providing a comprehensive view of their interactive pricing strategies. Observing Company 2’s reaction function, we notice that if Company 1 were to set its price at zero, Company 2 would still opt for a price above zero, as indicated by its reaction function’s intercept on the x-axis. Moreover, the positive slope of Company 2’s reaction function suggests a strategic response pattern: as Company 1 increases its price, Company 2 will also elevate its price proportionally.\nThis addition of Company 2’s reaction function to the plot not only enriches our understanding of the market dynamics but also sets the stage for identifying the equilibrium point where both companies’ strategies converge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Reaction functions for Company 1 and Company 2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2 not only illustrates the individual reaction functions of Companies 1 and 2 but also reveals a critical intersection point between them. This intersection signifies where each company’s optimal pricing strategy, or best response, aligns with the other’s. In seeking to optimize, both companies naturally gravitate towards setting their prices on their reaction functions. The convergence of these functions at a single point highlights the only scenario where both firms can simultaneously choose their best responses. This point of intersection defines the optimal, equilibrium prices in our differentiated Bertrand oligopoly, as depicted in Figure 13.3.\nThe emergence of this equilibrium, however, raises a pertinent question: How do Bertrand competitors, without any coordination, arrive at the equilibrium prices where their reaction functions intersect? While it’s conceivable that both firms could analytically deduce and simultaneously choose the exact equilibrium prices, real-world evidence suggests this is not commonly the case.\nIn practice, firms often reach the Bertrand equilibrium through a process of observation and reaction. Take, for instance, Company 2 setting its initial price at zero as depicted in Figure 13.3. In response, Company 1 would set its price at the intercept of its reaction function. Company 2, observing this, adjusts its price upward to align with its reaction function, as indicated by the bottom arrow in Figure 13.3. This iterative process, characterized by a series of adjustments and counter-adjustments, eventually leads the firms to converge at the equilibrium. The key is consistent observation and responsive action, ensuring that each firm continually adjusts its pricing in line with the evolving market dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Reaction functions for Company 1 and Company 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBertrand-Nash Equilibrium\n\n\n\nThis logic of both companies choosing their best response to their competitor is known as a Nash equilibrium.1 Since we are seeking the equilibrium prices in a differentiated Bertrand oligopoly, this equilibrium is known as a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium or the Bertrand equilibrium for short.",

Pepsi in Bertrand Competition\nCoca-Cola and Pepsi, two of the most iconic soft drink brands, exemplify the dynamics of differentiated Bertrand competition. Utilizing demand and cost curves estimated from historical data,1 we can delve into their competitive strategies and profitability within the Bertrand framework.\nLet’s designate Coca-Cola as Company \\(\\mathsf{c}\\) and Pepsi as Company \\(\\mathsf{p}\\). Their respective demand curves have been estimated as2\n\nCoke’s demand curve: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad Q_c = 63.42 - 3.98\\ P_c + 2.25\\ P_p}\\)\nPepsi’s demand curve: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad Q_p = 49.52 - 5.48\\ P_p + 1.40\\ P_c}\\)\n\nThese demand curves suggest a scenario where a price increase by Coke (Company \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)) relative to Pepsi (Company \\(\\mathsf{p}\\)) would reduce Coke’s sales, but not all Coke consumers would switch to Pepsi. This reflects the brand loyalty found among consumers of differentiated products.\nThe estimated variable unit costs for Coke and Pepsi are:\n\nCoke’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_c = \\$4.96}\\)\nPepsi’s variable unit cost: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad c_p = \\$3.96}\\)\n\nIncorporating these costs into the demand functions, we derive the profit functions for each company:\n\nCoke’s profit: \\(\\mathsf{ \\quad \\pi_c = (P_c - c_c) (63.42 - 3.98\\ P_c + 2.25\\ P_p) }\\)\nPepsi’s profit: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad \\pi_p = (P_p - c_p) (49.52 - 5.48\\ P_p + 1.40\\ P_c)}\\)\n\nNext, we determine the reaction functions for each company:\n\nCoke’s reaction function: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad P_c = 10.45 + 0.2827\\ P_p}\\)\nPepsi’s reaction function: \\(\\mathsf{\\quad P_p = 6.498 + 0.1277\\ P_c}\\)\n\nFigure 13.4 illustrates these reaction functions and the Bertrand equilibrium optimal prices for Coke and Pepsi.

    "text": "13.5 Conclusion\nAs we conclude our exploration of Bertrand oligopolies and their implications for entrepreneurial ventures, several critical lessons emerge. These lessons are not just theoretical musings but practical guidelines for navigating the complex landscape of market competition.\n\nExercise Pricing Discipline\nOne of the most important takeaways is the concept of pricing mutual forbearance. In the relentless quest to attract customers, the temptation to engage in aggressive price cutting can be strong. However, our analysis underscores the peril of this approach, particularly in undifferentiated markets. Instead, firms must practice restraint and avoid triggering destructive price wars that erode profitability for all players involved. Recognizing and respecting the pricing strategies of competitors can lead to a more stable and sustainable competitive environment.\n\n\nThe Significance of Product Differentiation\nDifferentiated Bertrand competition highlights the value of product differentiation and the discipline it brings to pricing strategies. Differentiation allows firms to escape the trap of competing solely on price, enabling them to command premium prices for unique product features that resonate with specific customer segments. This approach not only helps in maintaining healthy profit margins but also fosters innovation and brand loyalty.\n\n\nMeasure Competitiveness for Evidence-Based Decisions\nFinally, the ability to compete effectively is not a matter of guesswork. It requires a rigorous measurement of expected profits and a deep understanding of one’s competitive position. In the realm of entrepreneurship, where resources are often limited and the cost of missteps high, making evidence-based decisions is crucial. By quantitatively assessing how well a venture can compete against its rivals, entrepreneurs can make informed strategic choices, from pricing to product development.\nIn conclusion, the journey through the nuances of Bertrand oligopolies reveals much about the strategic underpinnings of effective competition. For entrepreneurs, the lessons learned here are invaluable. They provide a framework for understanding market dynamics, a guide for strategic decision-making, and a reminder of the importance of innovation and customer focus. By applying these insights, entrepreneurs can navigate the competitive landscape with greater confidence and precision, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and success.\n\n\n\n\n\nGasmi, Farid, Quang Vuong, and J.

    "text": "14.1 Rethinking Market Size: A Shift Towards Profitability Analysis\nThe Traditional Approach: Market Size Estimates\nIn both corporate and entrepreneurial settings, market size estimates are traditionally used to gauge the profit potential of investments in innovation. The idea is simple: a larger market size suggests greater profit opportunities if a product gains a certain market share. This method, however, relies heavily on hypothetical scenarios and often overlooks crucial factors like market share attainability and industry entry barriers.\nThe Limitations of Market Size as a Profit Proxy\nMarket size, while indicative, isn’t always a reliable proxy for profitability. For example, a sizable market like the cola industry may seem lucrative, but high entry barriers can drastically limit market share for new entrants. Existing measures like Total Addressable Market (TAM),1 Serviceable Available Market (SAM),2 and Target Market,3 though refined, still fall short because they don’t fully account for the dynamics of market entry, especially for market makers who are creating new segments.\nA More Direct Approach: Estimating Profitability Through Customer Demand\nA more direct and informative approach involves estimating the demand curve specific to the innovation. This method integrates customer pain points with the effectiveness of the proposed solution. A larger target market, better solution efficacy, and greater differentiation from existing products all contribute to higher expected profitability. This approach, grounded in differentiated Bertrand oligopoly models, allows for the calculation of equilibrium prices, quantities, market shares, and profits, providing a more accurate and actionable profitability estimate.",

    "text": "Understanding Profit as a Truer Measure of Market Potential\nRevenue vs. Profit: Shifting the Focus\nTraditional market size metrics, like total addressable market, often emphasize total sales value. While this offers a sense of the revenue pool, it doesn’t necessarily reflect a company’s profitability. By using demand and profit functions, we can calculate expected revenue as a market size measure but with a crucial distinction - our primary focus is on profit maximization, not just revenue.\nProfit: A More Relevant Indicator for Investment Decisions\nInvestors typically rely on revenue proxies to gauge profit potential. However, actual profit figures provide a more accurate and meaningful measure for investment decisions. As our earlier calculations showed, understanding the profit per company helps in determining the viability of investment and continued operation.\nProfit as a Predictor of Long-Term Success\nIt’s important to note that these profitability estimates reflect a scenario where the product is well-known, resembling its mature market stage. This perspective aligns well with traditional market size metrics but offers a more realistic and actionable forecast for long-term success.\n\n\nProfitability in Practice: An Illustrative Case\nUnderstanding Demand Curves and Profit Functions\nConsider a scenario in a differentiated Bertrand oligopoly involving two companies. Their demand curves and profit functions can be mathematically expressed, leading to reaction functions that help determine optimized equilibrium prices, quantities, and profits. This mathematical approach, while intricate, offers a tangible way to predict market behavior and profitability.\nLet’s apply this to a hypothetical situation where two companies with identical costs and differentiation exist in a market. Using specific parameters, we can calculate equilibrium outcomes, providing insights into potential revenues and profits. The demand curves are\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{Q_1} &= \\mathsf{a_1 - b_1\\ P_1 + b_{12}\\ P_2} \\\\[6pt]\n\\mathsf{Q_2} &= \\mathsf{a_2 - b_2\\ P_2 + b_{21}\\ P_1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere ai is the intercept of Company i, bi is the “own price” slope of Company i, and bij is the “competitor price” slope (the substitution effect of the price of Company j) for the product of Company i.\nFrom these demand curves, we get profit functions for both Companies:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{\\pi_1} &= \\mathsf{(P_1 - c_1)\\ Q_1 - f_1} \\\\[5pt]\n               &= \\mathsf{(P_1 - c_1)\\ (a_1 - b_1\\ P_1 + b_{12}\\ P_2) - f_1} \\\\[15pt]\n\\mathsf{\\pi_2} &= \\mathsf{(P_2 - c_2)\\ (a_2 - b_2\\ P_2 + b_{21}\\ P_1) - f_2}\n\\end{align}\n\\] where ci is the variable cost per unit of Company i and fi is the fixed cost of Company i.\nMaximizing profit generates reaction functions that we solve either iteratively or as a system of equations to find the differentiated Bertrand equilibrium prices, quantities, and profits. Skipping the math, the formula for the optimized equilibrium prices is\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{P_1^*} &= \\mathsf{\\frac{-2 a_1 b_2 + 2 b_1 b_2 c_1 + a_2 b_{21} - b_2 b_{21} c_2}\n                     {4 b_1 b_2 - b_{12} b_{2}}} \\\\[16pt]\n\n\\mathsf{P_2^*} &= \\mathsf{\\frac{-2 a_2 b_1 + 2 b_2 b_1 c_2 + a_1 b_{12} - b_1 b_{12} c_1}\n                     {4 b_2 b_1 - b_{21} b_{12}}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThese optimal price formulas allow us to quickly calculate prices, quantities, and profits. Let’s do that for a particular set of parameters. Make two companies that are equally differentiated and have identical costs:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{a_1} &= \\mathsf{a_2 = 100} \\\\\n\\mathsf{b_1} &= \\mathsf{b_2 = 2} \\\\\n\\mathsf{b_{12}} &= \\mathsf{b_{21} = 1} \\\\\n\\mathsf{c_1} &= \\mathsf{c_2 = 25}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWith these parameters, we can calculate that the equilibrium outcome is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{P_1^*} &= \\mathsf{P_2^* = 50} \\\\[3pt]\n\\mathsf{Q_1^*} &= \\mathsf{Q_2^* = 50} \\\\[3pt]\n\\mathsf{\\pi_1^*} &= \\mathsf{\\pi_2^* = 1250}\n\\end{align}\n\\] ### Revenue as Market Size: Traditional vs. Analytical Perspectives\nTraditional View: Total Sales Value as Market Size Indicator\nTraditionally, market size metrics like Total Addressable Market focus on the total value of sales in the market. This approach provides an overview of the available revenue pool for companies. It’s a straightforward method to gauge market potential but doesn’t necessarily reflect a company’s true profit potential.\nAnalytical Shift: Revenue Estimation through Demand and Profit Functions\nIn contrast, our analytical approach calculates expected revenue using demand and profit functions, offering a more nuanced measure of market size. For instance, at optimal prices, we estimate revenue to be $2500 per company. This method not only quantifies the revenue but also aligns it with strategic pricing and market dynamics.",

Investors often rely on revenue figures as rough proxies for profit. However, calculating optimal profit provides a more accurate and actionable measure of a company’s potential. For example, we determined an optimal profit of $1250 per company.\nProfit as a Long-term Success Predictor\nIt’s important to note that these profit estimates are based on a mature market understanding of the product, as if the product is well-established. Early-stage products typically see lower sales, growing as brand awareness and market penetration increase. Thus, profit, in this context, is a projection of the company’s potential as it matures, offering a more strategic perspective compared to traditional revenue-based market size metrics.\nNavigating the Growth Path\nThe transition from initial sales to achieving this profit potential involves significant investment in brand development, production capacity, and market expansion. Balancing pricing strategies with investment in growth is critical. The optimal growth rate should balance these elements, a topic that warrants further exploration to fully understand how competitive advantages impact this trajectory.",

    "text": "14.3 Decoding Competitive Advantages: A Bertrand Model Analysis\nIntroduction to Competitive Dynamics in Business\nIn this section, we delve into the intricate world of competitive advantages through the lens of the Bertrand oligopoly model. Our goal is to examine how variations in key parameters—market size, price sensitivity, customer loyalty, and unit variable cost—affect a business’s pricing, market share, and profitability. This analysis will provide entrepreneurs with practical insights into strategic decision-making.\n\nMarket Size (a1)\n\nPrices\nWhen Company 1’s target customer segment expands, indicating an increase in market size, how does it affect its pricing strategy compared to its competitor, Company 2? We use the Bertrand model to map these changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium prices of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (a1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: As Company 1’s market size increases, its optimal pricing strategy changes, potentially allowing it to either increase market share or improve profit margins.\n\n\nQuantities\nNext, we explore how these market size changes impact the quantities sold by both companies:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium quantities of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (a1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Takeaway: An increase in market size typically leads to higher sales volumes, but entrepreneurs must balance this with pricing strategies to ensure optimal profitability.\n\n\nMarket Share\nMarket share is crucial in understanding a company’s position in the market. Here’s how an increase in market size for Company 1 affects its market share relative to Company 2:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium market shares of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (a1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nPractical Implication: Gaining a larger market share can be a significant competitive advantage, but it should be weighed against profitability goals.\n\n\nMargins\nMargins are a direct indicator of profitability. Let’s see how changes in market size influence the margins of both companies:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium margins of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (a1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Strategy Insight: Maintaining healthy margins while expanding market size is key to sustainable growth.\n\n\nProfits\nUltimately, profit is the goal. Here’s how market size affects the profits of Company 1 and Company 2:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium profits of Company 1 and Company 2 when market size of Company 1 (\\(a_1\\)) changes.\n\n\n\n\nClearly, profits rise much more quickly for Company 1 than for Company 2 when Company 1 has a competitive advantage in market size.\nEntrepreneurial Insight: An increased market size can significantly boost profits, but strategic pricing and cost management are essential to capitalize on this advantage.\n\n\nReal-World Applications and Strategic Implications\nIn practice, an increase in market size could be due to various factors, such as shifts in customer preferences, regulatory changes, or market expansions. Entrepreneurs should use these insights to hypothesize potential market changes and test these hypotheses with data-driven analytics.\nThis analysis provides a framework for understanding how different competitive advantages impact a company’s profitability. It underscores the importance of strategic decision-making in leveraging these advantages, with a focus on optimizing profits while maintaining a competitive edge in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice Sensitivity (b1)\nUnderstanding Price Sensitivity with a Bertrand Oligopoly Model\nIn this subsection, we explore the concept of price sensitivity (b1) in the context of the Bertrand model and its implications for business strategy. Price sensitivity reflects how customers react to price changes—higher sensitivity means customers are more likely to change their buying behavior in response to price fluctuations. Let’s analyze how varying degrees of price sensitivity impact Company 1’s profitability and competitive position.\n\nPrices\nHow does a change in Company 1’s customers’ price sensitivity affect the pricing strategies of both Company 1 and its competitor, Company 2? We use the Bertrand model to demonstrate this:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium prices of Company 1 and Company 2 when price sensitivity of Company 1 customers (b1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: A lower price sensitivity (b1) in Company 1’s customers leads to a more significant increase in its prices compared to Company 2. This non-linear, exponential increase in prices with small changes in price sensitivity illustrates a pricing advantage for Company 1.\n\n\nQuantities\nNow, let’s examine how price sensitivity affects the quantities sold by both companies:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium quantities of Company 1 and Company 2 when price sensitivity of Company 1 customers (b1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Implication: Interestingly, as Company 1’s price sensitivity decreases, its demand rises less than Company 2’s. This indicates that while Company 1 can increase prices without losing many customers, it also cedes some market share to Company 2 due to the substitution effect.\n\n\nProfits\nFinally, let’s see how varying levels of price sensitivity impact the profits of Company 1 and Company 2:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium profits of Company 1 and Company 2 when price sensitivity of Company 1 customers (b1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurial Insight: Reduced price sensitivity significantly enhances Company 1’s profits compared to Company 2. This suggests that businesses with less price-sensitive customers can leverage this advantage for substantial profit gains, even more so than gains from increased market share.\n\n\nReal-World Examples and Strategic Considerations\nExamples of reduced price sensitivity leading to higher profits are evident in companies like Apple and Tesla. These companies have successfully developed products and brand identities that resonate deeply with their customers, allowing them to maintain higher prices without losing customer loyalty.\n\nStrategic Questions for Entrepreneurs\n\nHow can your business decrease customer price sensitivity?\nCan you develop product features or branding that align closely with customer preferences?\nIs there an opportunity to create a community or status around your product that adds value beyond its physical attributes?\n\nThis analysis highlights the power of price sensitivity as a competitive advantage. Understanding and strategically leveraging this aspect can lead to significant profitability, even in markets where your company may not be the largest player. Entrepreneurs should focus not just on market share, but also on how to position their products in a way that reduces customer price sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Loyalty (b12 and b21)\nIn this section, we analyze how customer loyalty impacts a company’s strategic decisions and profitability within a Bertrand oligopoly framework. Customer loyalty is a nuanced competitive advantage that plays a crucial role in a company’s pricing strategy and market dynamics. Company 1 has a competitive advantage in customer loyalty when it gains more customers from Company 2 raising prices than it loses to Company 2 after a price increase. We examine these substitution effects (b12 and b21) that determine the degree of customer loyalty and their influence on Company 1’s pricing and profitability.\n\nPrices\nHow does an increase in Company 1’s customer loyalty affect its equilibrium prices compared to its competitor, Company 2? We explore this through our model:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium prices of Company 1 and Company 2 when customer loyalty for Company 1 (b12 and b21) changes.\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: As Company 1’s customer loyalty increases, more customers leave Company 2 to buy from Company 1 when Company 2 raises its price (b12 effect). At the same time, increasing customer loyalty for Company 1 means that fewer customers of Company 1 move to Company 2 when Company 1 raises its price (b21 effect). Increasing customer loyalty causes Company 1 to steadily decrease its optimal price while Company 2 raises its price. Company 1 can reduce prices to attract customers from Company 2 without risk of a price war.\n\n\nProfits\nFinally, we assess how these loyalty-driven pricing strategies impact the profits of both companies:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium profits of Company 1 and Company 2 when customer loyalty for Company 1 (b12 and b12) changes.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Implication: The analysis reveals that Company 1’s strategy to lower prices, driven by increased customer loyalty, is profitable. Despite reduced prices, Company 1 gains enough customers from Company 2 to increase its overall profits. This underscores the value of cultivating customer loyalty as a competitive advantage.\n\n\nReal-World Applications and Strategic Considerations\n\nHow can you build customer loyalty?\nAre there branding or service strategies that can increase customer retention even if prices are adjusted?\nConsider the long-term benefits of customer loyalty over short-term profit maximization. Customer loyalty is not just about retaining customers but also about leveraging this loyalty for strategic pricing and market share gains. The key for entrepreneurs is to understand how increased loyalty can be used to strategically adjust prices and capture a larger market share, ultimately leading to higher profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit Variable Cost (c1)\nHow does a competitive advantage in unit variable cost (c1) impact a company’s pricing strategy and profitability in a Bertrand oligopoly. We explore how changes in Company 1’s unit costs influence its market positioning and financial outcomes, providing key insights into cost management strategies.\n\nPrices\nWhat happens to the equilibrium prices of companies 1 and 2 when Company 1 gains a variable cost advantage? Let’s visualize this through our model:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium prices of Company 1 and Company 2 when variable cost of Company 1 (c1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: A decrease in Company 1’s unit variable cost allows it to reduce prices more effectively than Company 2. This strategic lowering of prices not only attracts more customers from Company 2 but also improves Company 1’s profit margins due to the reduced costs.\n\n\nProfits\nNow, let’s assess how these cost-driven pricing strategies impact the profits of both companies:\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium profits of Company 1 and Company 2 when cost of Company 1 (c1) changes.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Implication: Company 1’s profit increases significantly as its unit cost decreases. This rise in profit is attributed to both the increased margin resulting from lower costs and the gain in market share driven by reduced prices. It highlights the dual benefit of cost management — enhancing profitability while increasing competitive market presence.\n\n\nReal-World Applications and Strategic Considerations\n\nHow can your company achieve similar cost advantages? Consider options like optimizing supply chains, investing in efficient technologies, or negotiating better terms with suppliers.\nReflect on the balance between reducing prices to gain market share and maintaining prices to maximize profit margins.\nUnderstand that cost management is not just an operational issue but a strategic tool that can significantly impact market dynamics and profitability.\n\nUnit variable cost is a strategic lever in competitive markets. By effectively managing and reducing costs, a company can not only improve its profitability but also enhance its competitive position through strategic pricing. For entrepreneurs, this insight provides a clear directive: vigilantly manage costs and strategically utilize cost advantages to gain a market edge.",

    "text": "Entry Barriers in Practice\nWhile entry barriers pose significant challenges to entrepreneurs, they also serve as protective moats for incumbents. These barriers can manifest in various forms, from cost advantages to customer loyalty and market control.\n\n\nTwo Main Types of Entry Barriers\n\nCost-Based Barriers: These barriers are often rooted in economic advantages that established companies hold over new entrants. They include:\n\nEconomies of Scale: Larger firms can spread their costs over a greater number of products, allowing them to offer lower prices.\nLearning Curves (Learning by Doing): Established firms gain efficiency and cost advantages over time as they refine their processes and operations. This learning effect can create a significant barrier for new entrants who start at a higher cost base.\nAccess to Proprietary Technologies: Exclusive technologies or processes can give incumbents a distinct cost advantage that is hard for new entrants to replicate.\n\nMarket Share-Based Barriers: These barriers arise from the established market position of incumbents and include:\n\nBrand Loyalty: Strong brand recognition and customer loyalty can make it difficult for new entrants to attract customers.\nExclusive Partnerships and Agreements: Deals with suppliers, distributors, or other stakeholders can create a network that is difficult for newcomers to penetrate.\nControl Over Distribution Channels: Ownership or control over key distribution channels can prevent new entrants from accessing the market effectively.\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Amazon’s E-Commerce Supremacy\nAmazon’s rise to e-commerce supremacy is a prime example of how incumbents use entry barriers to maintain their market position. Their journey offers valuable lessons in the strategic use of multiple entry barriers.\nBuilding Economies of Scale: Amazon started as a modest online bookstore but quickly expanded its product range. This expansion allowed Amazon to build economies of scale, lowering operational costs and enabling competitive pricing that new entrants find hard to match.\nBrand Loyalty and Trust: Over the years, Amazon has cultivated strong customer loyalty through consistent service quality, vast product selection, and customer-centric policies like easy returns. This brand loyalty acts as a significant barrier for new companies trying to persuade customers to switch.\nTechnology and Data Analytics: Amazon’s sophisticated use of data analytics and technology in logistics, product recommendations, and customer experience sets a high standard. Their technological infrastructure provides a cost and efficiency advantage that is a formidable challenge for new entrants.\nControl Over Distribution Networks: Amazon’s vast distribution network, including a mix of fulfillment centers and partnerships, ensures fast and efficient delivery. Their control over these channels presents a significant hurdle for newcomers who lack the infrastructure to compete on delivery times.\nInnovation and Diversification: Amazon continually innovates, venturing into new markets like cloud computing (AWS) and digital streaming (Amazon Prime Video). This diversification strategy keeps them ahead and presents varied challenges for entrants in different sectors.\nUtilizing Marketplace Dynamics: Amazon Marketplace has become a platform for third-party sellers, further entrenching Amazon’s position. While it offers opportunities for small businesses, it also reinforces Amazon’s market dominance as they control the platform and gather valuable data.\nThrough these strategies, Amazon has not only protected its position but has continued to expand its influence across various markets. Their approach demonstrates the multifaceted nature of entry barriers and how an incumbent can effectively leverage them to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nFor entrepreneurs, understanding these barriers is vital to strategize effectively for market entry. It’s about identifying not just the gaps in the market but also considering how to navigate or leverage these entrenched barriers to carve out a viable space for your business.",

Here, we explore various methods that entrepreneurs have successfully used to overcome daunting entry barriers. While these strategies are inspired by various sources,1 they are tailored to fit the modern entrepreneurial landscape.\n\nFinding Niche Markets: Often, the key to entering a market with high barriers is to start small. Target a niche market that the big players have overlooked or considered too insignificant to pursue. This approach allows you to establish a foothold without directly confronting larger incumbents.\nLeveraging Technology and Innovation: Use technology and innovation to create a unique value proposition. This could involve developing a new product, a disruptive business model, or a technological breakthrough that changes the rules of the game.\nBuilding Strategic Partnerships: Forming alliances or partnerships can provide access to essential resources, distribution networks, or market insights. Partnerships, especially with established players, can lend credibility and reduce the perceived risk by potential customers.\nUtilizing Regulatory Changes: Stay attuned to regulatory changes that might level the playing field. For instance, new regulations may open up previously inaccessible markets or impose constraints on incumbents that newcomers can exploit.\nFocus on Customer Experience: Differentiate yourself by offering an exceptional customer experience. This can include superior service, user-friendly interfaces, or personalized offerings that incumbents may not provide.\nCrowdfunding and Community Support: Utilize crowdfunding platforms to not only raise capital but also to build a community of supporters. This can validate your product in the market and generate early buzz.\nAgile and Lean Start-Up Approaches: Embrace agility and the lean start-up methodology to quickly adapt to market feedback, pivot when necessary, and innovate continuously. This agility can be a significant advantage over larger, less flexible incumbents.\n\n\n\nCase Study: Tesla’s Market Entry Strategy\nTesla’s foray into the automotive industry is a textbook example of overcoming substantial entry barriers with a blend of innovative strategies. Facing formidable challenges such as the high development costs of electric vehicle (EV) technology and the entrenched brand loyalty of established automotive giants, Tesla charted its own path to success.\nKey to Tesla’s strategy was their focus on initially targeting a niche market of high-end electric vehicles. This allowed them to build a strong brand without directly confronting larger incumbents. They then expanded their reach, using their established reputation as a launchpad.\nInnovation was at the heart of Tesla’s approach. They leveraged cutting-edge technology to create vehicles that stood out from traditional options, both in terms of performance and environmental impact. This focus on innovation extended to their business model as well; their direct-to-consumer sales approach disrupted the traditional dealership model, reconfiguring the automotive value chain.\nTesla also capitalized on government incentives for EVs, which helped offset the high initial costs and made their cars more accessible to a broader market.\nMoreover, Tesla placed a strong emphasis on customer experience, from the design of their cars to their unique marketing strategies and customer service. This focus helped them cultivate a loyal customer base and distinguish themselves in a crowded market.\nThrough these strategies, Tesla didn’t just manage to enter the automotive industry; they transformed it, highlighting how a deep understanding and strategic navigation of entry barriers can not only facilitate market entry but also create a lasting competitive edge.",

    "text": "15.3 Leveraging Entry Barriers for Competitive Advantage\n\nCreating and Strengthening Entry Barriers to Close the Door Behind You\nOnce you’ve successfully entered a market, the next strategic move is to ‘close the door behind you.’ This means creating or strengthening entry barriers to secure your market position and deter potential competitors. Here are key strategies to consider:\n\nProduct Differentiation: Differentiate your product or service to create a unique market position. This can involve innovation in design, features, or technology that sets your offering apart. Product differentiation makes it harder for new entrants to offer a comparable alternative that attracts your customer base.\nIntellectual Property (IP) Protection: Secure your innovations legally. Patents, trademarks, and copyrights can provide legal barriers to entry, protecting your unique products, services, or even branding from being replicated by competitors.\nScaling Effectively: As your business grows, aim to achieve economies of scale. This means optimizing your operations to lower costs as your production volume increases. Economies of scale can act as a barrier by making it financially challenging for new entrants to compete at the same cost level.\nBuilding Brand Loyalty: Invest in building a strong brand. Customer loyalty is a powerful barrier to entry, as it requires new competitors to overcome the trust and recognition you’ve established with your market.\nExclusive Partnerships and Agreements: Establish exclusive partnerships with suppliers, distributors, or other key stakeholders. Such agreements can limit the access new entrants have to essential resources or market channels.\nContinual Innovation: Stay ahead of the curve by continually innovating. This could mean regularly updating your product line, adopting new technologies, or finding novel ways to enhance customer experience.\n\n\n\nCase Study: Apple’s Strategic Defense Through Entry Barriers\nApple Inc.’s journey in securing its market position is a masterclass in effectively leveraging entry barriers. From its early days to its current status as a tech giant, Apple has consistently employed a range of strategies to ‘close the door’ behind them.\n\nEarly Strategies for Market Protection\n\nInnovative Product Design and User Experience: In the early years, Apple set itself apart with the Macintosh, which offered a unique user interface vastly different from the prevailing command-line interfaces. This focus on intuitive design and user experience became a hallmark of Apple’s product differentiation.\nBuilding a Robust Ecosystem: Apple began creating an integrated ecosystem with the launch of iTunes and the iPod. This ecosystem strategy, expanded later with the iPhone and App Store, created a seamless experience for users, significantly raising entry barriers for competitors.\n\n\n\nOngoing Strategies to Maintain Market Position\n\nIntellectual Property (IP) Vigilance: Apple has aggressively protected its innovations through patents and trademarks. This IP strategy includes iconic designs and functionalities, creating legal hurdles for competitors attempting to replicate their success.\nBrand Building and Loyalty: Apple’s brand, symbolizing innovation, quality, and exclusivity, has cultivated a loyal customer base. Their brand loyalty is a significant barrier, making it challenging for new entrants to sway Apple’s customers.\nScaling with Supply Chain Mastery: As Apple grew, they mastered supply chain efficiencies, achieving economies of scale that allow them to price competitively, despite their premium positioning. This scale makes it challenging for new entrants to match their price and quality.\nExclusive Partnerships: Apple has formed strategic partnerships, like their exclusive contracts with certain component suppliers and major telecom companies for iPhone distribution, restricting competitors’ access to these resources.\nContinued Innovation and Diversification: Apple’s continuous innovation, seen in their consistent updates to existing products and expansion into new markets like wearable technology and services, keeps them ahead of potential entrants.\n\n\n\nThe Cumulative Effect\nThese strategies have created a cumulative effect, fortifying Apple’s position against new entrants. From the Macintosh’s early breakthrough to the iPhone’s revolutionary impact and beyond, Apple’s journey demonstrates a multi-faceted approach to leveraging entry barriers, ensuring their market dominance throughout different technology eras.",

Unlike in perfect competition, where firms act independently of each other and price falls to cost, businesses in oligopolistic or differentiated markets must anticipate and react to competitors’ actions.\nGame theory offers a lens to understand and navigate this intricate network, highlighting how strategic choices are intertwined. It underscores the critical insight that the success of your decisions hinges on the interconnected strategies within your business ecosystem. This understanding is pivotal for several reasons:\n\nEnhanced Competitive Insight: By acknowledging the interconnected nature of market actions, entrepreneurs can better predict competitor reactions, enabling strategic moves that are informed, proactive, and one step ahead.\nInformed Strategic Choices: Grasping the concept of interdependence aids in identifying actions that not only advance your position but also shape the competitive landscape in your favor, thus fostering optimal strategic decision-making.\nOpportunities for Collaboration: Beyond competitive dynamics, game theory also reveals avenues for negotiation and cooperation, identifying potential alliances that bolster your competitive stance.\n\nThrough game theory, entrepreneurs gain the ability to not just react to the competitive environment but to actively influence its evolution, equipping them with the strategies to thrive in tomorrow’s market.",

In markets with perfect competition, this is largely true—with myriad economic actors acting in their own self-interest, the “invisible hand” naturally directs the market to the best outcome for society.optimize market outcomes.\nHowever, as dramatized in A Beautiful Mind, John Nash pointed out that when competitors’ choices influence each other, independent optimization fails. The best outcomes occur not when each player does what is best for themselves in isolation, but when each player chooses what is best for themselves given what others are doing. Like Adam Smith, Nash recommends that you should pursue your self-interest but you should pursue your individual ambition in response to the behavior of the other players.\nThis is the essence of game theory—understanding how strategic interdependence shapes competition and decision-making.",

Competitive Pricing Strategies\nMany entrepreneurs assume they can set prices freely to maximize their own profits. However, in competitive markets, price changes trigger responses from rivals.\nFor example, if a startup cuts prices to gain market share, competitors may match the cut, leading to a price war that reduces profits for everyone. Undiferentiated Bertrand competition models show that rational competitors tend to undercut each other until price equals cost—a dangerous trap for startups without a cost advantage.\nKey Lesson: Game theory helps businesses anticipate competitive price reactions* and develop differentiation strategies that avoid price wars.\n\n\n2. Market Entry and Deterrence Strategies\nWhen entering a new market, a startup must consider how incumbents will react. If a dominant firm threatens to lower prices to drive new entrants out, should the startup ignore the threat?\nUsing game theory and backward induction, an entrepreneur can determine whether such a threat is credible. If the incumbent has no incentive to follow through, the startup can confidently enter the market. However, if the incumbent has committed to cost-cutting investments, its threat may be real, and entry may need to be reconsidered.\nKey Lesson: Game theory helps predict whether competitive threats are credible, guiding smarter entry decisions.\n\n\n3. Negotiation and Strategic Alliances\nGame theory doesn’t just apply to rivalries—it also helps entrepreneurs negotiate effectively with investors, suppliers, and partners. For example, if a startup is seeking venture capital funding, multiple investors may be competing to invest. Should the startup hold out for better terms or accept an early offer?\nA game-theoretic approach can help entrepreneurs:\n\nRecognize when investors have an incentive to negotiate aggressively.\n\nUse commitment strategies to increase their bargaining power.\n\nIdentify collaborative game structures where win-win partnerships emerge.\n\nKey Lesson: Game theory provides a framework for optimizing negotiations and securing advantageous deals.",

    "section": "17.2 Pricing Game with a Single Nash Equilibrium",
    "text": "17.2 Pricing Game with a Single Nash Equilibrium\nLet’s begin with a variation on the Prisoner’s Dilemma, tailored to an entrepreneurial context. Two startups, selling basically the same product through an online retail platform, are considering whether to cut prices to gain market share. The startups face the challenge of making their decisions in tandem, without the luxury of knowing the other’s choice ahead of time. The consequences of their decisions are heavily dependent on the combination of actions they each take, showcasing the strategic complexity and uncertainty inherent in competitive markets.\nWe build and solve the game working systematically through the five stages:\n\nStep 1: Identify the Players\nPlayers: The two competing startups contemplating price reductions are the players in this particular game:\n\nStartup A (You), and\nStartup B (Your Competitor).\n\n\n\nStep 2: Outline Possible Actions\nActions: Each startup has two options:\n\nto cut prices (Cut) or\nto maintain current prices (Hold).\n\n\n\nStep 3: Determine Payoffs\nPayoffs represent the outcomes of different combinations of actions, defined here as ordinal values. These values rank the preferences of the players without specifying exact monetary benefits, where a payoff of 2 is more desirable than a payoff of 1, but is not necessarily twice as good.\n\nWhen both choose to hold: Margins remain stable, leading to moderate gains for each, scored as a 1.\nWhen one cuts while the other holds: The startup that cuts price captures additional market share, earning a payoff of 2, while the other, maintaining its prices, faces a disadvantage, incurring a payoff of -2.\nWhen both decide to cut: a price war ensues, diminishing profits for both parties, reflected by payoffs of -1 each.\n\nArmed with an understanding of the players, their possible actions, and the associated payoffs, we’re equipped to layout the game in a normal form matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.1: Players, actions, and payoffs of the startup pricing (prisoner’s dilemma) game.\n\n\n\nIn this representation:\n\nThe “row player” (Startup A), shown in blue, faces the decision to hold or cut prices.\nSimilarly, the “column player” (Startup B), illustrated in green, navigates the same choices.\nThe matrix delineates the ordinal payoffs for Startup A (row player) in the bottom left of each cell and for Startup B (column player) in the upper right, corresponding to every possible action pairing.\n\nThis visual and structured approach to defining the game scenario illuminates the strategic interplay at hand, setting the stage for further analysis to discern optimal strategies and anticipate potential equilibrium outcomes.\n\n\nStep 4: Identify Player Strategies\nIn game theory, a player’s strategy encompasses the suite of actions they would select as their best response to every potential move their competitor might make. An action qualifies as a best response when it secures the highest payoff among the available options.\nFor Startup A, strategic decisions hinge on Startup B’s pricing actions:\n\nIf Startup B opts to hold its prices, Startup A can maximize its benefit by cutting its own prices. This aggressive pricing strategy yields a higher payoff of 2, as opposed to the moderate gain of 1 that comes with maintaining price levels.\nIf Startup B cuts its prices, Startup A finds its most favorable outcome (-1) in reciprocating the price cut, aligning with Startup B’s aggressive strategy.\n\nStartup A’s strategic pattern can be visually represented using directional arrows pointing towards actions yielding the highest payoffs, based on Startup B’s decisions.1 As illustrated in Figure 17.2, both arrows for Startup A direct towards a price cut, indicating a strategy for Startup A to always opt for a price reduction, irrespective of Startup B’s choice.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2: Startup A’s strategy in the (prisoner’s dilemma) pricing game – cut if Startup B chooses hold and cut if Startup B chooses cut.\n\n\n\nStartup B’s strategy mirrors this approach:\n\nFacing a price hold from Startup A, Startup B’s advantageous move is to cut prices.\nSimilarly, when Startup A cuts prices, Startup B’s best strategy remains to cut, maintaining competitive parity.\n\nThis analysis reveals a pivotal insight: both startups are inclined towards a dominant strategy of price reduction under all circumstances, setting the stage for a potential price war. This is a normal form representation of undifferentiated Bertrand competition that eventually descends into price wars and zero profits. Such a scenario underscores the strategic intricacies inherent in competitive markets, where anticipating and countering the moves of rivals can define the contours of business success.\n\n\nStep 5: Solve for Equilibrium\nThe Nash equilibrium3 is the strategic point where all players in a game settle on choices that leave them with no incentive to pursue a different course of action, provided that every other player remains constant in their strategy. This state of mutual best responses occurs when each player’s strategy is the best they can opt for, considering the strategies chosen by their competitors.\nThe game’s matrix, illustrated in Figure 17.3, highlights strategies through arrows pointing towards actions that garner the highest payoffs. The Nash Equilibrium is achieved when both startups opt to reduce prices, a strategy represented by arrows converging on the cut/cut decision. This scenario not only instigates a price war, diminishing profits for both entities but also exemplifies a dominant strategies equilibrium, where each firm’s unilateral decision to cut prices reflects the optimal response to the anticipated action of the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.3: The Nash Equilibrium in this entrepreneurial pricing game arises at cut/cut, signifying simultaneous best responses leading to potentially suboptimal collective outcomes.\n\n\n\nThis real-world rendition of the Prisoner’s Dilemma epitomizes a broader class of strategic games where players, driven by dominant strategies, inadvertently converge on outcomes that might not serve their collective best interests. Through this lens, the dilemma doesn’t just offer a theoretical exercise but rather a practical reflection on the dynamics of competitive strategy, underscoring the critical importance of strategic foresight and the potential consequences of uncoordinated competitive aggression.\n\n\nPractical Application: Navigating Competitive Strategy\nThe Prisoner’s Dilemma isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a vivid illustration of the strategic decisions entrepreneurs face daily. It highlights the importance of considering both the immediate impact of your actions and how competitors might respond.\nAggressive strategies, like price cuts, may offer quick wins but understanding the broader dynamics of competition can guide you towards strategies that ensure long-term market stability and profitability.\nMastering game theory’s principles, as demonstrated through the Prisoner’s Dilemma and its Nash equilibrium, empowers entrepreneurs to:\n\nForecast Competitor Behavior: Identifying dominant strategies helps predict competitor moves, giving you a strategic edge.\nLook Beyond the Short Term: It encourages strategies that safeguard against potential market disruptions, favoring sustainable success.\nFind Collaboration Opportunities: Understanding mutual dependencies can reveal partnerships that amplify your competitive advantage.\nClarify Decision-Making: Game theory models offer a clear visual framework to assess strategies and their outcomes, making complex decisions more manageable.\n\nWhile pricing competition is a crucial element of game theory, entrepreneurs must consider a broader range of strategic interactions. Real-world business dynamics often involve multiple levers beyond simple price cuts. Here are some additional competitive responses that shape market positioning:\n\nCompetitive Responses Beyond Pricing\nEntrepreneurs often compete on dimensions other than price. Some key alternative competitive responses include:\n\nMarketing Campaigns: Startups may strategically allocate marketing budgets to influence consumer perception and demand. For example, a well-timed social media blitz or influencer partnership can capture attention and shift market share without resorting to price cuts.\nNew Product Launches: Firms may introduce differentiated products or expanded service offerings as a way to compete. Unlike price reductions, which erode margins, product innovation can create sustained competitive advantages.\nBranding and Customer Loyalty: Strong branding can reduce price sensitivity among customers. Apple, for instance, maintains premium pricing due to its brand equity and loyal customer base.\nCustomer Experience and Service: Exceptional service, seamless user experiences, and personalized engagement can create differentiation that justifies premium pricing.\nProduct Differentiation: Unique features, superior design, or proprietary technology can shift competition away from pure price wars and toward value-based competition.\nExclusive Partnerships: Aligning with key distribution channels, supply chain partners, or complementary brands can provide an advantage that competitors may struggle to replicate.\n\nThese responses illustrate how strategic competition is more than just a pricing game—it involves actively shaping market dynamics through innovation, visibility, and differentiation. For startups, these strategies are especially valuable because they allow for growth without engaging in destructive price-based competition that erodes profitability.\n\n\nRegulatory and Ethical Considerations\nEntrepreneurs must also navigate the external constraints imposed by regulations and ethical norms. Game theory assumes rational decision-making, but legal and reputational factors often add complexity:\n\nRegulatory Constraints: Price-fixing laws, antitrust regulations, and advertising restrictions can shape the feasible strategies available to startups. Understanding these legal considerations is crucial in competitive decision-making.\nEthical Considerations: Beyond legality, ethical business practices influence long-term success. Aggressive undercutting may generate short-term gains but damage brand reputation or invite retaliatory actions from competitors.\nIndustry Standards and Reputation: In some industries, informal agreements and industry standards may act as stabilizing forces, discouraging price wars and promoting cooperation.\n\nThese factors highlight that competitive strategy is not purely a mathematical exercise—it requires a nuanced understanding of external forces, incentives, and long-term consequences. By considering a diverse set of strategic responses beyond price cuts, entrepreneurs can position their businesses for sustainable success in competitive markets.",

    "text": "17.3 Strategic Partnerships to Address Multiple Equilibria\nThe dynamics of strategic partnerships often mirror those found in coordination games, characterized by the presence of multiple equilibria. These scenarios challenge firms to make decisions that not only serve their own interests but are also critical for the collective success of the alliance.\nImagine two startups, each with its own specialized technology, considering a strategic alliance. The effectiveness of their partnership is contingent on selecting operational standards or development trajectories that are mutually compatible. This decision-making process is akin to navigating a coordination game, where the most favorable outcomes are achieved through synchronized choices.\n\nIdentifying the Players and Actions\nThe players in this scenario are:\n\nStartup A, with a specialization in software development,\nStartup B, specializing in hardware production.\n\nTheir actions involve choosing between two operational standards or development paths: Standard X or Standard Y.\n\n\nDetermining Payoffs\nThe payoffs reflect the compatibility of operational standards and the synergy effect on the partnership:\n\nBoth choose Standard X: High compatibility and synergy, leading to significant mutual benefits.\nBoth choose Standard Y: Similar to X, but with nuances that slightly favor Startup B’s hardware orientation.\nDisparate choices lead to compatibility issues, diminishing the potential benefits of the partnership.\n\n\n\nConstructing the Game in Normal Form\nThe game matrix, visualized in Figure 17.4, elucidates the outcomes based on the combinations of choices by the startups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.4: Construction of the partnership coordination game.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy and Equilibria\nIn this partnership game, both startups aim to align on a standard, understanding that compatibility maximizes the partnership’s value. The game is solved in Figure 17.5 where the presence of multiple Nash equilibria reflects the possible outcomes where each startup’s choice complements the other’s, ensuring mutual benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.5: Strategies and equilibrium outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication to Strategic Partnerships\nThe presence of multiple equilibria in such a strategic decision-making context underscores the need for mechanisms that can guide the startups toward a single, mutually beneficial equilibrium. This could involve pre-negotiation agreements, shared vision sessions, or adopting a sequential decision-making approach where one startup’s choice informs the other’s decision, akin to moves in a sequential game.\nSuch strategies not only help align the startups’ decisions but also build a foundation for trust and cooperation, essential elements for the success of any strategic partnership. By effectively navigating these coordination challenges, startups can leverage their alliance as a competitive advantage, driving innovation and capturing greater market share.\nStrategic partnerships, through the lens of game theory, reveal the complexities and opportunities inherent in collaboration. By understanding and applying the principles of coordination games, firms can more effectively navigate the intricacies of partnership dynamics, steering towards decisions that enhance both their individual prospects and collective success.\n\n\nStrengthening Strategic Partnerships: Alliances and Coordination Mechanisms\nStrategic partnerships are crucial in entrepreneurial settings, where startups often rely on collaborations to navigate resource constraints, enter new markets, or accelerate innovation. Unlike direct price-based competition, partnerships introduce coordination challenges, where multiple equilibria exist, and firms must align on mutually beneficial decisions.\n\nReal-World Startup Alliances\nIn many industries, startups and incumbents must coordinate on technology choices, supply chain integrations, and market positioning. Some examples include:\n\nTech Stack and Platform Compatibility: Startups developing software or digital products often must align on technology choices to ensure interoperability. Choosing a cloud provider (e.g., AWS vs. Azure) or adopting an industry-standard API format can create coordination challenges, where an early misalignment can lead to costly integration issues.\nSupply Chain and Logistics Partnerships: E-commerce startups may face coordination dilemmas in logistics. Partnering with a fulfillment provider like Amazon FBA or developing a direct-to-consumer (DTC) logistics network each presents strategic trade-offs that impact long-term efficiency.\nIndustry Ecosystems and Standardization: Some industries rely on agreed-upon protocols to ensure compatibility. For example, electric vehicle (EV) startups must decide whether to adopt Tesla’s charging standard or align with broader industry standards like CCS (Combined Charging System).\n\nIn each case, multiple equilibria exist, and firms must navigate these coordination dilemmas to ensure mutual success.\n\n\nPre-Negotiation and Commitment Mechanisms\nCoordination games often suffer from equilibrium selection problems—there may be multiple stable outcomes, but the challenge is ensuring all players choose the same one. Entrepreneurs can use commitment mechanisms and pre-negotiation strategies to resolve these dilemmas.\n\nPre-Negotiation Agreements: Before finalizing strategic choices, startups can engage in pre-negotiation discussions to align expectations. For example, a startup entering a new market may negotiate distribution partnerships ahead of time to signal commitment to a particular channel.\nPublic Commitments and Announcements: Declaring a choice publicly can serve as a strategic commitment. For instance, when Apple announces support for a particular wireless standard or payment technology, it influences suppliers and app developers to follow suit.\nLong-Term Contracts and Exclusivity Deals: Startups can lock in key partnerships through contractual commitments. An early-stage fintech company might secure an exclusive banking partnership to create a stable foundation before competitors can respond.\nRegulatory or Industry-Guided Standardization: Sometimes, external entities help resolve coordination issues. Government policies or industry consortia (e.g., the USB-IF for USB standards) can enforce a particular equilibrium, reducing strategic uncertainty.\n\nBy leveraging commitment mechanisms, startups can guide competitors, suppliers, and partners toward an outcome that maximizes collective benefits rather than leaving the equilibrium selection to chance.\n\n\nApplication to Entrepreneurial Strategy\nUnderstanding coordination games enables entrepreneurs to: - Recognize when collaboration is more beneficial than competition. - Influence equilibrium selection through pre-commitment and strategic signaling. - Avoid misalignment pitfalls that increase costs or reduce market opportunities.\nAs markets evolve, game theory provides entrepreneurs with powerful tools to structure alliances, negotiate agreements, and shape industry standards. Mastering these concepts allows startups to gain competitive advantages not just through direct competition, but by strategically orchestrating partnerships that define the future of their industries. “)",

    "section": "17.4 Navigating Uncertainty with Mixed Strategies: Rock-Paper-Scissors",
    "text": "17.4 Navigating Uncertainty with Mixed Strategies: Rock-Paper-Scissors\nRock-paper-scissors, beyond being a childhood game, exemplifies strategic decisions in scenarios lacking a clear Nash Equilibrium. This game illustrates that sometimes, business strategies don’t lead to straightforward outcomes and that embracing flexibility and unpredictability can be advantageous.\n\nConstructing the Game\nIn constructing payoffs for rock-paper-scissors, we use ordinal payoffs to signify preferences rather than exact values. For instance, tying might have a payoff of 0, a win 1, and a loss -1, setting a baseline for evaluating outcomes. The formal game is represented in Figure 17.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.6: Construction of the rock-paper-scissors game.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving the Game\nThe solution to the rock-paper-scissors game is given in Figure 17.7 with curious results. The strategies of both players are not hard to find but there is no Nash equilibrium. Analysis reveals no single strategy guarantees a win, because there is every cell has an arrow leaving meaning that there is no outcome that is simultaneously a best response for both players. When you build and solve bespoke games for your context, you may not find a pure strategies equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.7: Strategies with no Nash equilibrium outcome that can be shown in normal form.\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed-strategies Equilibrium\nWhen the game has no Nash equilibrium, you may turn to the concept of mixed-strategies, randomizing decisions for direction in decision-making. The problem for players of rock-paper-scissors is that any action can be countered with an action that will always win. It doesn’t take long for players (often children) to learn that they must randomize their choice or they will always lose. If they place \\(\\mathsf{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) probability on each choice to avoid predictability, they will lose one-third of the games, win one-third, and tie one-third.\nThis approach is a mixed-strategy and leads to a mixed-strategies equilibrium. It does not tell you what action to take but it does help you choose randomization. The equilibrium does not allow us to predict the outcome that will happen but it does predict the the probability of any outcome. This is an equilibrium because no player has an incentive to deviate.\nThis approach underscores the importance of adaptability and the potential to incorporate randomness into strategic planning, especially in highly competitive or uncertain markets. While Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple illustrative example, mixed strategies play a significant role in high-stakes entrepreneurial and strategic decisions.\n\n\nReal-World Examples of Mixed Strategies in Entrepreneurship\nEntrepreneurs and startups frequently encounter situations where randomization is an optimal strategy:\n\nOnline Advertising Bidding Wars: Many digital advertising platforms (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads) operate on auction-based pricing models. If a company repeatedly bids on the same keywords with a fixed strategy, competitors can exploit this predictability to drive up costs. A mixed strategy—randomly varying bid amounts and timing—prevents being undercut or outmaneuvered by rivals.\nStartup Funding and Investor Competition: In venture capital (VC) funding rounds, investors must decide which startups to back, and startups must strategically signal their valuation. If a VC always follows the same decision criteria, founders can game the system. A mixed-strategy approach (diversifying investments across different verticals or adjusting deal structures probabilistically) can mitigate bias and enhance portfolio resilience.\nCompetitive Pricing in Dynamic Markets: Ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft often adjust pricing dynamically based on supply and demand. If pricing were static, competitors could respond predictably, leading to price wars. Instead, using mixed strategies—varying price surges and discounts unpredictably—helps maintain profitability while avoiding exploitative competitor behavior.\nCybersecurity and Fraud Prevention: Online platforms must prevent fraudulent activities and cyberattacks, yet attackers adapt quickly to static defenses. By randomizing fraud detection measures or security updates, companies create an unpredictable barrier that makes it harder for adversaries to anticipate vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nProbabilistic Decision-Making in Entrepreneurship\nEntrepreneurs often operate under high uncertainty, where traditional deterministic decision-making is insufficient. Mixed strategies provide a systematic way to embrace uncertainty and optimize decisions probabilistically.\n\nAvoiding Exploitable Predictability: If competitors, customers, or investors can perfectly anticipate a startup’s next move, they may exploit this knowledge. Introducing randomness into pricing, promotions, or feature rollouts can prevent strategic manipulation.\nBalancing Risk and Innovation: Startups frequently face choices between pursuing a risky innovation or a safer, incremental improvement. By allocating resources probabilistically—testing multiple ideas in parallel or investing in a mix of short-term and long-term projects—entrepreneurs hedge against failure while maintaining innovation momentum.\nMarket Entry and Expansion Timing: Startups entering new markets must decide when to launch. If competitors can predict the exact timing, they may preemptively launch competing products or block access to key suppliers. A mixed-strategy launch schedule, with staggered or randomized market entry timing, can help mitigate competitive responses.\n\n\n\nStrategic Benefits of Mixed Strategies\nEntrepreneurs leveraging mixed strategies can:\n\nDisrupt competitor expectations by making decisions less predictable.\nOptimize decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in zero-sum or adversarial markets.\nEnhance long-term resilience by diversifying strategic actions rather than relying on a single deterministic path.\n\nMastering mixed strategies allows entrepreneurs to thrive in uncertain and competitive environments, leveraging probabilistic thinking to gain strategic advantages in dynamic markets.",

This approach ensures that insights are directly applicable, guiding you toward informed strategic decisions in real scenarios.”\nA pivotal step in applying game theory is defining payoffs—the outcomes of strategic decisions. We’ll explore both ordinal and cardinal payoffs: ordinal payoffs simplify strategic preferences without specific values, offering a clear view of options, while cardinal payoffs provide a detailed, quantitative analysis of decisions’ impacts. By mastering these methods, you’ll be equipped to use game theory effectively, leveraging strategic insights for competitive advantage.\n\nOrdinal Payoffs: A Logical Approach\nIdentifying payoffs is a crucial yet challenging step in game theory, particularly when the strategic scenario defines players and actions clearly, but payoffs remain ambiguous. For ordinal payoffs, the key is to ensure they represent a clear ranking of outcomes without necessitating specific values or units. Start by selecting a baseline scenario and assigning payoffs that mirror the expected order of preferences. For instance, in a rock-paper-scissors game, a tie scenario like Rock/Rock might be assigned a payoff of 0/0. This sets a foundation to then value a win at one point and a loss at negative one, simplifying the construction of the game matrix based on these relative rankings.\nOrdinal payoffs expedite game building by sidestepping detailed financial calculations, provided they accurately reflect the preference order. By methodically considering the relative merits of different strategic outcomes, you not only craft a clearer game structure but also enhance your strategic insights, enabling informed decision-making and predictable outcomes.\n\n\nCardinal Payoffs: A Competition Analytics Approach\n\nWhile ordinal payoffs rank outcomes based on preferences, cardinal payoffs require quantifiable insights often not evident through mere speculation. These payoffs, crucial for understanding the tangible outcomes of strategic choices, are derived from profit analytics. Whether it’s profits from a one-time differentiated Bertrand competition or the net present value (NPV) of ongoing competitive profits, cardinal payoffs quantify the financial impact of decisions over the duration of interdependence between players. This depth of analysis, rooted in profit calculations, provides a comprehensive view of potential strategic outcomes.\n\nA Demonstration Case of Airbus and Boeing Choosing to Develop a New Aircraft\nConsider Airbus and Boeing, evaluating whether to develop a new, technologically advanced aircraft. This strategic decision is influenced by potential market responses, competitive actions, and financial implications. Here’s how we break down their game using cardinal payoffs derived from profit analytics.\nPlayers: Airbus and Boeing\nActions: Each can either Innovate or Not Innovate.\nPayoffs: Derived from a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, reflecting the net present value (NPV) of the calculated Bertrand oligopoly profits over 20 years. These are hypothetical yet realistic figures based on competitive analytics and demand forecasts:\n\nBoth not innovate: Airbus NPV = $30B; Boeing NPV = $40B.\nAirbus innovate, Boeing not innovate: Airbus NPV = $40B; Boeing NPV = $20B.\nBoeing innovate, Airbus not innovate: Airbus NPV = $20B; Boeing NPV = $30B.\nBoth innovate: Airbus NPV = -$10B; Boeing NPV = -$20B.\n\nThe determination of these payoffs involves extensive data collection and demand analysis. For instance, we estimate demand curves for each scenario, accounting for variable and fixed costs—including R&D investments. This process, while data-intensive, is crucial for major strategic decisions that could define the company’s future.\nStrategies and Equilibrium:\nThe game matrix, illustrated in Figure 17.8, reveals that Boeing has a dominant strategy not to innovate, allowing Airbus to launch the new aircraft and secure an enhanced competitive position in the advanced technology market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.8: Construction and solution of a game in normal form where Airbus and Boeing decide whether to launch a new aircraft: Boeing has a dominant strategy not to launch so Airbus launches and profits from a newly achieved competitive advantage.\n\n\n\nThis example underscores the significance of grounding strategic decisions in solid analytics. While ordinal payoffs offer quick strategic insights, cardinal payoffs provide the depth necessary for high-stakes decision-making, ensuring strategies are not just intuitive but analytically sound.",

Entrepreneurs must anticipate and counter rival moves, often without knowing their strategies in advance. Through normal form representation, we can model strategic interactions and identify Nash equilibria that reveal stable competitive outcomes.\nHowever, real-world business decisions extend beyond simple price wars:\n\nSome markets involve coordination dilemmas, where firms must align on standards or collaborate.\nOthers require randomized strategies to avoid predictability in adversarial settings.\nEntrepreneurs can shape outcomes by leveraging commitments, pre-negotiations, or differentiating their offerings.\n\nMastering game theory enables entrepreneurs to outthink competitors, recognize exploitable patterns, and anticipate market dynamics. As we transition into sequential games, we will see how timing, commitment, and foresight can further refine strategic decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\nNash, John Forbes. 1950. “The Bargaining Problem.” Econometrica 18: 155–62.\n\n\n———. 1951. “Non-Cooperative Games.” Annals of Mathematics 54: 286–95.",

    "text": "18.1 Introduction\nIn many situations, the assumption that all companies act at the same time strains credibility. Many real-world strategic decisions unfold in a sequence rather than all at once. In sequential games, players make their moves one after another, allowing later players to react to the decisions of those who acted before them. This sequence of moving and responding fundamentally changes the game’s dynamics and treating them like a simultaneous game leads to flawed strategies and disappointing outcomes.\nFor example, in a coordination game like the battle of the sexes, if one of the players chooses a venue first, the other can respond only to that venue. In this case, one of the equilibria disappears and the reasonable risk of the worst outcome is eliminated. More generally, making the assumption that games are played simultaneously when they are actually played in sequence leads to incorrect strategies and uncertain equilibria.",

    "text": "18.2 Non-Credible Threats\nIn sequential games, the timing and order of decisions are not insignificant details. The ability to observe and react to a competitor’s move can be a significant strategic advantage. The ability to anticipate a competitor’s response allows players to move pre-emptively and shape the competitive environment in their favor. Moving first, for example, allows a firm to make strategic commitments that can deter competitors, secure resources, or lock in advantageous positions by forcing competitors to respond to the early mover on less favorable terms.\nIn sequential games, the dynamics go beyond mere observation and response. They open up the possibility of non-credible threats, where a player might threaten to take actions that, upon closer inspection, wouldn’t actually be in their interest to carry out. Such threats, lacking in credibility, should typically be ignored, as they’re unlikely to be acted upon. Distinguishing between credible and non-credible strategies becomes a critical skill in navigating the strategic landscape of sequential games.\nThankfully, the challenge of identifying and countering non-credible threats can be systematically addressed by constructing the game in an extensive form (essentially, a decision tree) and solving it through backward induction. This method for identifying strategies, simplifies the analysis by breaking down the game into a sequence of decisions to choose the best response, starting from the end and working backwards. By doing so, it becomes evident which threats or actions are actually in a player’s interest to follow through on, based on the outcomes of subsequent moves.\nThis method not only clarifies which strategies are credible but also enhances strategic planning and decision-making. It allows entrepreneurs and strategists to anticipate competitor moves more accurately, devise responses that effectively counter non-credible threats, and leverage their own strategic moves for maximum impact. Through the use of extensive form games and backward induction, the complex interdependencies of sequential decisions become navigable, empowering businesses to craft strategies that are both informed and actionable.",

The entrepreneur’s choices are to enter or not enter, while the monopolist can fight the entry with aggressive pricing or accommodate by sharing the market. The outcomes are quantified as follows:\n\nEnter and fight: The entrepreneur faces a $5M loss, while the monopolist gains $4M.\nEnter and accommodate: Both parties profit by $5M each.\nNot enter: Regardless of the monopolist’s choice, the entrepreneur gains nothing, and the monopolist secures a $12M profit.\n\nSolving this game in normal form reveals two Nash equilibria seen in Figure 18.1: one where the monopolist fights and deters entry, and another where the entrant enters and is accommodated. But which outcome is more likely?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.1: If the entry game is played simultaneously in normal form, the solution is two Nash equilibria where the monopolist may fight or accommodate and the entrant may enter or not enter.\n\n\n\nGiven the logical sequence of moves, the entrant must decide first, providing the monopolist with something to fight or accommodate. This sequential decision-making highlights the non-credibility of the monopolist’s threat to fight. If the entrant chooses to enter, knowing the monopolist’s best interest lies in accommodating, the threat of a price war becomes ineffective. This realization negates the not enter/fight equilibrium, leaving enter/accommodate as the most plausible outcome.\nThe crux of sequential games is recognizing that threats lacking in credibility—those not in a player’s best interest to execute—should not influence decision-making. The sequencing of moves clarifies which strategies are bluffs and which are genuine, guiding players towards rational and beneficial outcomes. This principle is pivotal in strategic environments where timing and order of actions shape the competitive landscape, enabling players to navigate complex scenarios with foresight and precision.",

    "section": "Solving Sequential Games Through Backward Induction",
    "text": "Solving Sequential Games Through Backward Induction\nTo solve sequential games in extensive form, we use a method known as backward induction, which clarifies the decision-making process by working from the game’s end back to its start. This method helps us pinpoint the best response at each decision point, considering the subsequent moves of other players.\nReturning to our monopolist-entrant game in extensive form, we start with the monopolist’s final decisions. Given the choice between a price war and maintaining high prices after the entrant has entered, the monopolist prefers the latter, yielding a higher payoff. This preference is represented in Figure 18.3 by a bolded arrow towards the high price decision, indicating the monopolist’s best response. When the entrant does not enter, we move to the lower node for the monopolist where it retains monopoly status regardless of whether if fights or accommodates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.3: Solving the entry game in extensive form through backward induction: best responses are indicated by bolded arrows, leading to the sub-game perfect equilibrium.\n\n\n\nThe entrant, considering the monopolist’s response, finds entering the market to be the best move, given it leads to a mutually beneficial profit sharing. This decision path is marked, leading to the game’s equilibrium point, where both firms play their best responses simultaneously.\nThe key outcome of backward induction is the sub-game perfect equilibrium, which inherently discounts non-credible threats. Unlike in our initial normal form game, where the monopolist’s threat of a price war might deter entry, sequential analysis reveals such threats as non-credible. The monopolist, in reality, would choose to accommodate entry, rendering the price war strategy implausible when actions unfold over time.\nThus, the sub-game perfect equilibrium identified through backward induction is a refined Nash equilibrium specific to sequential games.1 It focuses on credible strategies by considering the actual sequence of moves, ensuring that only feasible outcomes—those based on rational, best-response strategies—are considered viable. In doing so, it sidesteps the ambiguity of non-credible threats found in simultaneous-move games, offering a clear pathway to strategic decision-making in real-world scenarios.",

Strategic commitment goes beyond this—it is about changing the structure of the game itself, influencing competitors’ future choices before they act.

Instead of keeping his fleet ready for retreat, he burns his ships. The message to his troops is clear: there is no turning back, win or perish. This act transforms the strategic landscape. His soldiers fight with a new level of commitment, and the enemy, recognizing their desperation, may lose confidence. The same logic applies in business—companies can make strategic decisions that shape competitor behavior, customer expectations, and even regulatory landscapes.\nAt its core, strategic commitment is about creating and reinforcing competitive advantages.

If the commitment is weak or easily reversible, competitors will simply ignore it and continue with their own best strategies. To be effective, a commitment must be:\n\nVisible – Competitors must clearly see and understand the commitment.\nUnderstandable – The logic behind the commitment must be apparent.\nCredible – The firm must not be able to back out of the commitment without severe consequences.\nIrreversible – The commitment should be costly or impossible to undo.\n\nConsider Tesla’s investment in Gigafactories. By committing billions of dollars to battery production, Tesla signaled to competitors that it was locked into electric vehicles for the long term. This investment was both visible and irreversible, forcing other automakers to take Tesla seriously and rethink their strategies. Contrast this with companies that make vague announcements about “future electric vehicle ambitions” or plan to buy their batteries rather than make them—these are not commitments because they lack credibility.\nAnother classic example is Southwest Airlines’ fleet strategy. Southwest committed to using only Boeing 737 aircraft, which allowed the company to reduce maintenance costs, simplify training, and improve efficiency. Because this was a public and irreversible commitment, it sent a strong signal to competitors that Southwest had a durable cost advantage in the airline industry.",

    "text": "19.3 Types of Strategic Commitments\nStrategic commitments come in many forms. Each type affects competitors, customers, and suppliers differently, shaping industry outcomes in unique ways.\n\n1. Capacity Expansion\nWhen a firm commits to increasing production capacity, it signals to competitors that price competition may not be worth it. If a new entrant knows that an established firm can flood the market with low-cost products, they may hesitate to enter.\nExample: Amazon invested billions in massive fulfillment centers allowed it to offer faster delivery at lower costs, making it harder for smaller competitors to keep up. The investment signaled to competitors that it was committed to cost leadership and fast delivery and the commitment was credible because investment was large and largely irreversible.\n\n\n2. Fixed Cost Investments\nCompanies that invest in expensive, industry-specific infrastructure can signal long-term commitment to a market. This discourages competitors who may be unsure about their own return on investment.\nExample: Intel’s multi-billion-dollar semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) require enormous upfront investment, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to compete without similar investments.\n\n\n3. Product Positioning\nA firm can commit to differentiating itself from competitors in a way that makes direct competition difficult. This often involves brand loyalty, unique technology, or niche market focus.\nExample: Apple’s commitment to high-end, premium-priced devices signals that it is not interested in competing on price, forcing competitors to either match its quality or pursue budget-conscious consumers.\n\n\n4. Contracts and Exclusivity\nExclusive agreements can lock in key suppliers or customers, making it difficult for competitors to operate efficiently.\nExample: Microsoft’s multi-billion-dollar partnership with OpenAI ensured exclusive access to cutting-edge AI models, limiting competitors’ ability to use the same technology.\n\n\n5. Regulatory and Political Commitments\nFirms can shape industry regulations in ways that create barriers to entry. This may involve lobbying, standard-setting, or long-term compliance investments.\nExample: Uber actively lobbied for regulations that favored ride-sharing platforms, ensuring its business model became legally entrenched in many cities.\nExample: 1-800-Contacts could not legally implement its business model until lobbying removed regulation requiring contact lens sellers to also write the prescriptions.",

    "text": "19.4 Strategic Commitment in a Sequential Entry Game\nIn our study of sequential games, we considered a monopolist facing a potential entrant. Initially, the monopolist’s threat to fight against entry seemed credible, but when we analyzed the game sequentially, the threat fell apart. The entrant recognized that the monopolist’s threat was not credible because its best response was to accommodate entry rather than engage in a costly price war. Enty occured and the monopolist accommodated as expected. This is a pretty lousy outcome for a monopolistic competitor who seemingly has the upper hand against the entrant.\nNow, let’s introduce strategic commitment into the game. The monopolist, seeking to deter entry, can invest in moving down its learning curve—lowering variable costs to sustain aggressive pricing while maintaining profitability against future entrants that do not have the same efficiencies. This investment transforms the game. Before, the entrant could count on the monopolist accommodating. Now, the monopolist has credibly signaled that it can afford to fight, making entry less attractive.\nThe opportunity for the monopolist to invest in enhanced efficiency and lower costs adds another stage to the sequential entry game. Specifically, we add an earlier stage where the monopolist must decide whether to “invest” in strategic commitment by investing in efficiency and learning.\n\nIf the monopolist does not invest, the game is unchanged;\nif it does invest, the monopolist can sustain lower prices in the future and the payoffs change.\n\nAfter investment, the payoff of a price war increases from $4M to $8M. This new game, with its attempted strategic commitment, is constructed and solved in Figure 19.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.1: Construction and solution of the entry game with strategic commitment: Monopolist is able to deter entry in a sequential game.\n\n\n\nAs before, if the monopolist does not invest, a competitor will enter the market and both firms will split profits. However, if the monopolist invests in cost-cutting technology, the potential entrant may decide not to enter because competing would be unprofitable.\nThe game tree in extensive form reveals that the investment changes the equilibrium outcome:\n\nIf the monopolist does not invest, the entrant enters and both firms make moderate profits.\n\nIf the monopolist invests, the entrant stays out, and the monopolist keeps all profits.\n\nBy strategically committing to cost reduction, the monopolist effectively deters entry, reshaping the game in its favor.",

The Flexibility Problem\nCommitments that lack built-in adaptability can become liabilities when market conditions change.\nExample: Blackberry’s commitment to physical keyboards made sense at first, but when touchscreens became dominant, it struggled to pivot.\nExample: Tesla’s commitment to battery production in its Gigafactories is difficult to adapt when overall demand for electric vehicles falls after many new entrants have entered.",

    "text": "19.6 Actionable Takeaways for Entrepreneurs\nStrategic commitment is not just for large corporations—entrepreneurs can use these principles to shape markets, deter competitors, and strengthen positioning.\nBefore committing, ask:\n\nIs this investment visible, credible, and irreversible?\nHow will competitors react? Does this commitment deter or provoke competition?\nDoes this commitment give us a durable competitive advantage, or does it lock us into a fragile position?\nCan this commitment be leveraged for funding, partnerships, or market dominance?\n\nIn general, different competitive environments point to different opportunities for commitment:\n\nCommit to cost leadership early if scale is a feature of the prodution technology.\nUse branding and exclusivity for differentiation if customer needs are highly variable.\nPrioritize flexibility and avoid commitments that limit your ability to adapt to market changes when markets are uncertain and subject to frequent, rapid change.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategic commitment. As competitive environments differ based on their unique combination of customers, competitors, technologies, and suppliers. Any successful strategic commitment must target the specific peculiarities of the competitive environment.",

By making deliberate, irreversible moves, firms can shape industry dynamics, deter rivals, and secure profitability. However, commitment must be credible and strategic—poorly designed commitments can backfire.
