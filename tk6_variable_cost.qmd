# Esimtate Variable Cost per Unit {#sec-toolkit-variable-cost-chapter .unnumbered}

#### *What It Really Costs to Serve One More Customer*

This toolkit supports one narrow but critical task:

> *Estimating what it costs to serve one additional unit of demand—well enough to reason about feasibility.*

The goal is not precision.  
The goal is to avoid missing costs that matter.

Early ventures rarely fail because variable costs were estimated imprecisely.  
They fail because key costs were never noticed at all.

This toolkit exists to prevent that kind of failure.

::: {.callout-note title="How this toolkit fits" icon=false collapse=true}
This toolkit is a practical companion to [Chapter 9: Cost](ch9_cost.qmd).  
It helps you estimate variable cost per unit—the quantity that feeds directly into profit reasoning and into the [Profit Analytics app](https://rconnect.byu.edu/ProfitAnalytics).

The goal is not accounting accuracy.  
The goal is decision-grade feasibility.

## What This Toolkit Is (and Is Not)

This toolkit is about *discipline*, not accounting.

It does not assume:

- a particular business type,
- a particular revenue model,
- or a particular level of operational maturity.

It does assume that:

- serving one more customer *triggers real activity*,
- that activity consumes resources,
- and those resources have costs—even when they are uncertain.

This toolkit will help you surface those costs deliberately.





## The Core Question

Every variable cost estimate begins with a single question:

> *What has to happen, operationally, for one more customer to be served?*

Not what *might* happen eventually.  
Not what *should* happen in a mature firm.

What actually has to happen *now*, given your current design.

If nothing happens when a customer buys, your variable cost is close to zero.  
If many things happen, variable cost is real—even if hard to estimate.






## Variable Cost Is About Triggers, Not Labels

In accounting, variable cost is defined mechanically.

For decision-making, a better definition is this:

> *A variable cost is any cost triggered by serving one more unit of demand.*

This framing matters because many costs that *feel* fixed are actually triggered by scale—and many costs that feel “minor” become decisive when multiplied.

To help surface these triggers, the sections below describe common ways variable costs enter a venture.

These are *mechanisms*, not requirements.

If a mechanism does not apply to your venture, leave it blank.

*Blank means “not triggered,” not “forgotten.”*

That distinction matters.






## Common Variable Cost Triggers

The categories below are prompts.  
They are designed to make it hard to accidentally ignore costs—not to force them where they don’t belong.


### 1. Production or Creation

> *What must be created or produced when one more customer is served?*

Examples include:

- materials and components,
- compute or API usage,
- content generation,
- labor time directly tied to delivery.

For physical products, this may resemble a bill of materials.  
For software or services, it may be time, computation, or setup effort.

The form differs.  
The trigger is the same.


### 2. Delivery or Fulfillment

> *What must be delivered, hosted, shipped, or made accessible?*

Examples include:

- shipping and handling,
- cloud hosting or bandwidth,
- onboarding or setup,
- logistics and returns.

Many delivery costs are *step-variable*:

- they are flat until capacity is reached,
- then jump when new capacity is required.

These costs are still variable in decision terms—even if they do not change smoothly.


### 3. Transactions

> *What costs are incurred when a sale occurs?*

Examples include:
- payment processing fees,
- platform or marketplace fees,
- per-transaction sales incentives,
- discounts that reduce realized revenue.

Price discounts belong here.  
They are not “strategy”—they are negative revenue triggered by transactions.

### 4. Support and Maintenance

> *What happens after the customer is served?*

Examples include:

- customer support,
- rework or retries,
- warranty claims, returns, or replacements,
- service recovery when things go wrong.

Many of these costs are **probabilistic**.
They occur only for some customers—but ignoring them is equivalent to assuming the probability is zero.

### 5. Acquisition (When Truly Per-Unit)

> *Does acquiring one more customer reliably incur cost?*

Examples include:

- performance advertising,
- commissions,
- referral payments.

Not all marketing spend is variable.
Treating fixed branding costs as per-unit costs is a modeling choice—not a fact.

Be explicit when you make that choice.






## A Discipline for Surfacing Costs

One effective way to practice this discipline is to keep a working cost table.

This is not an accounting statement.
It is a thinking aid.

Columns might represent:

- cost triggers (like the categories above),
- and rows the specific cost elements you believe are involved.

For each element, record:

- an estimate or range,
- and your confidence in that estimate.

Some entries may be well-known.  
Others may be weak guesses.

That is fine.

The danger is not guessing.
The danger is omitting.

If a category does not apply, leave it blank—and say why.

### Example: A Working Variable Cost Table (Illustrative)

The table below shows **one way** to surface variable cost components.
It is not complete, correct, or prescriptive.
Its purpose is to make the discipline concrete.

| Trigger Category | Cost Element | Estimate (per unit) | Confidence | Notes |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| Production / Creation | Component materials | \$42–\$55 | Medium | Supplier quotes vary by volume |
| Production / Creation | Assembly labor | \$18 | Low | Based on time estimate, not observed |
| Delivery / Fulfillment | Shipping | \$12–\$20 | Medium | Depends on zone and carrier |
| Transaction | Payment processing | ~3% of price | High | Platform fee schedule |
| Support / Maintenance | Returns / replacements | \$0–\$8 (expected) | Low | Probabilistic; rough guess |
| Acquisition | Performance advertising | — | — | Not triggered (organic acquisition) |

Some entries are ranges.  
Some are guesses.  
Some are blank.

That is intentional.

Blank means *not triggered*, not *forgotten*.

This table is not meant to produce a single “correct” variable cost.

Its purpose is to make the structure of cost visible—so you can see which components matter, which are uncertain, and which assumptions are doing the most work.

A variable cost estimate becomes *decision-grade* when you can reasonably answer three questions:

- Which cost components dominate the total?
- Which components are most uncertain?
- How wrong could these estimates be before feasibility changes?

If small errors in one row would reverse your conclusion, that row deserves attention.
If large uncertainty in another row barely matters, further precision is unnecessary.

At this stage, clarity about *sensitivity* matters more than numerical precision.








## From Components to a Decision-Grade Cost

Once cost components are surfaced, the goal is not to collapse them into a single “correct” number.

Instead:

- group them into plausible scenarios,
- identify conservative and optimistic cases,
- and ask how much error would change the decision.

A variable cost estimate is *decision-grade* when:

- you know which components matter most,
- you know which are uncertain,
- and you know how wrong you could be before feasibility changes.

That is enough.






## Common Red Flags

If your variable cost estimate feels clean, confident, and simple, pause.

Common warning signs include:

- counting only product or production cost,
- assuming zero support or post-sale effort,
- ignoring returns, failures, or exceptions,
- treating discounts as “marketing” rather than cost,
- or assuming scale will solve margins automatically.

These are not moral failures.
They are predictable blind spots.

This toolkit exists to surface them early—when they are still cheap to fix.







## Why This Matters for Profit Reasoning

Variable cost sets a hard boundary on feasibility.

If price does not exceed variable cost, selling more makes the situation worse.

This is why variable cost is reintroduced before fixed costs and profit.
It determines which parts of the demand curve are even worth considering.

Estimating variable cost carefully does not guarantee success.
But estimating it carelessly can guarantee failure.

Once variable cost is understood, attention can turn to fixed costs—where commitment, irreversibility, and risk truly enter the decision.
