In [Chapter 15](ch15_differentiated.qmd), we assumed symmetry with the rival.

Same cost.  
Same demand sensitivity.  
Same differentiation.

That is why equilibrium produced the same price for both firms.
But symmetry is not the goal of entrepreneurship.

Difference is.

Competitive advantage does not mean “trying harder.”  
It does not mean “believing more strongly.”  
It does not mean “marketing louder.”

It means changing structure.





## Breaking Symmetry

Return to the equilibrium price:

$$
\mathsf{P^* = \frac{a + bc}{2b - d}.}
$$

That expression contains everything.

If two firms differ in:

- Variable cost $\mathsf{c}$,
- Demand strength $\mathsf{a}$,
- Differentiation $\mathsf{d}$,

their best-response functions shift.

The intersection shifts.  
Equilibrium prices diverge.  
Profit diverges.  
*Advantage appears.*

Not because one firm chose differently at the same structure.  
But because the competitive profit structure itself is different.





## Three Structural Sources of Advantage

There are only three ways to shift equilibrium in your favor.

### 1. Lower Cost

A lower variable cost shifts your best-response function downward.

You can profitably set a lower price.  
You can survive price pressure others cannot.

Cost advantage does not eliminate rivalry.  
It makes you more durable within it.



### 2. Stronger Demand

If customers value your product more highly (higher $\mathsf{a}$), your demand curve shifts outward.

Your best-response line shifts upward.  
You charge more at equilibrium.

Revenue advantage becomes structural.



### 3. Greater Differentiation

If customers are less willing to switch away from you (lower effective substitution), the parameter governing rivalry changes.

Your equilibrium margin increases.

Differentiation does not remove competition.  
It reduces how tightly your price is pinned to the rival’s.






## Advantage Is a Shift, Not a Story

Competitive advantage is not a slogan.

It is a shift in parameters.

It moves the best-response function.  
It moves the intersection.  
It changes the equilibrium outcome.

That is why advantage must be structural.

Not rhetorical.
