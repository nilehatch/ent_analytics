In the previous chapter, we navigated the delicate dance of pricing in a competitive landscape—how to strategically set prices to maximize profits when those profits hinge on both your and your competitor's pricing decisions. This chapter takes us beyond the confines of pricing, venturing into the strategic battlegrounds where competitive advantages are forged. These are the arenas that shape the profit potential of your pricing strategies. Through the lens of game theory, we offer entrepreneurs a powerful toolkit to understand and master the competitive dynamics that dictate market positioning, drive innovation, and ultimately, fuel profitability. Game theory sheds light on the intricate strategic interplay between firms, revealing how decisions related to product development, pricing, and market entry are far from isolated—they're profoundly interconnected.

At its core, entrepreneurship is about pioneering innovation that aligns products with customer desires in uniquely compelling ways, and investing in capabilities to deliver to customers. These challenges are conquered not through price tags alone but through a deep understanding of the competitive landscape. This chapter is your guide through the complexities of these strategic interactions, spotlighting the game theoretic insights essential for securing competitive advantages. The essence of **competitive dynamics** is to engage in the strategic behavior that redefines the profit potential of pricing in competition. It is about competing on things other than price.

<br>

## Why Competitive Dynamics Matter to Entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs don't just participate in markets; they redefine them. They achieve this through differentiation—crafting products or services that don't merely compete on price but stand out through their unparalleled value propositions. This drive for distinction is at the heart of competitive dynamics in entrepreneurship. It's about making strategic decisions that not only reshape out your product's demand but also define your operational blueprint for efficiency. These decisions interlock, each one a strategic move in a grand game of entrepreneurial chess.

Game theory provides the strategic vantage point to view these decisions not as isolated choices but as integral parts of an ecosystem where your actions echo against those of your competitors. Game theory equips you with the foresight to understand these interdependencies, guiding you toward more strategic, informed decisions. This insight is invaluable; it lays the foundation for your competitive advantage long before pricing strategies come into play.

Thus, competitive dynamics are not just they sandbox you play in but the strategic moves that change the sandbox in your favor. They encapsulate the essence of strategic entrepreneurship: navigating a landscape where every decision you make is a strategic move, intertwined with the outcomes of others. This chapter delves into these dynamics, showcasing how game theory empowers entrepreneurs to not only compete but to excel in markets where innovation and differentiation are the keys to success.

## Game Theory in Entrepreneurship

Game theory is more than a theoretical construct or a toolkit for gamers to dominate at Monopoly; it's a critical framework for entrepreneurs navigating the competitive business landscape. It demystifies the complex process of strategic decision-making in an environment where outcomes are influenced not just by your actions, but also by the responses of competitors, partners, and customers.

### Strategic Interplay

Consider the marketplace as a strategic battleground where every move you make—a product launch, pricing strategy, marketing initiative, or operational improvement—is scrutinized and potentially countered by competitors. This interplay doesn't occur in a vacuum; it ignites a sequence of strategic responses, weaving a web of interdependencies.

Game theory offers a lens to understand and navigate this intricate network, highlighting how strategic choices are intertwined. It underscores the critical insight that the success of your decisions hinges on the interconnected strategies within your business ecosystem. This understanding is pivotal for several reasons:

-   **Enhanced Competitive Insight:** By acknowledging the interconnected nature of market actions, entrepreneurs can better predict competitor reactions, enabling strategic moves that are informed, proactive, and one step ahead.
-   **Informed Strategic Choices:** Grasping the concept of interdependence aids in identifying actions that not only advance your position but also shape the competitive landscape in your favor, thus fostering optimal strategic decision-making.
-   **Opportunities for Collaboration:** Beyond competitive dynamics, game theory also reveals avenues for negotiation and cooperation, identifying potential alliances that bolster your competitive stance.

Through game theory, entrepreneurs gain the ability to not just react to the competitive environment but to actively influence its evolution, equipping them with the strategies to thrive in tomorrow’s market.

### Building and Solving Strategic Games

We will follow the same structured approach to construct and solve all strategic games:

1.  **Identify the Players:** Pinpoint the competitors, customers, or partners influencing your market dynamics.
2.  **Identify Possible Actions:** Catalog the strategic options available to these players.
3.  **Determine Payoffs:** Assess the potential performance outcomes of these strategic choices.
4.  **Formulate Strategies:** Map the best reactions players can make in response to the moves of their competitors.
5.  **Solve for Equilibrium:** Identify the outcome that is most likely to happen where all players are making their optimal moves.

Mastering these steps isn’t just academic; it’s pragmatically necessary. This chapter applies these stages to various strategic scenarios. Our aim is not to exhaustively review known games and their lessons but to empower you to craft bespoke strategic games that reflect your unique competitive context.

In practice, the utility of game theory unfolds in its application to real-world challenges. While familiarity with pre-existing games provides a useful analogy for strategy development, the true power lies in customizing game theory principles to navigate your specific competitive landscapes. Thus, we focus on empowering you with the tools to create and solve games that resonate with your strategic needs, paving the way for informed decisions and sustainable competitive advantages.

<br>

## Simultaneous Games

We begin our study of game theory by considering simultaneous games:

-   Players are tasked with predicting their competitors' strategies without the benefit of observing their actions first. Simultaneity here means that all players make their decisions concurrently.

-   They choose strategies that encompass the comprehensive set of responses to every potential move a competitor might make. Thus, the focus shifts from reacting to actual actions to preparing for all conceivable ones.

-   They arrive at an equilibrium (expected outcome) where no players want to deviate because every player's decision has been accurately forecasted and counteracted with the best response.

We will construct and analyze simultaneous games using the **normal form** representation, which organizes a game into a matrix format. This approach serves as an excellent foundation for understanding the core principles involved in creating and solving games. It's essential for effectively applying game theory to real-world business challenges, offering a structured method to visualize and assess the strategic options and outcomes available to all players involved.

### Pricing Game with a Single Nash Equilibrium

Let's begin with a variation on the Prisoner's Dilemma, tailored to an entrepreneurial context. Two startups, selling basically the same product through an online retail platform, are considering whether to cut prices to gain market share. The startups face the challenge of making their decisions in tandem, without the luxury of knowing the other's choice ahead of time. The consequences of their decisions are heavily dependent on the combination of actions they each take, showcasing the strategic complexity and uncertainty inherent in competitive markets.

We build and solve the game working systematically through the five stages:

#### Step 1: Identify the Players {.unnumbered}

**Players:** The two competing startups contemplating price reductions are the players in this particular game:

-   Startup A (You), and
-   Startup B (Your Competitor).

#### Step 2: Outline Possible Actions {.unnumbered}

**Actions:** Each startup has two options:

-   to cut prices (`Cut`) or
-   to maintain current prices (`Hold`).

#### Step 3: Determine Payoffs {.unnumbered}

**Payoffs** represent the outcomes of different combinations of actions, defined here as *ordinal* values. These values rank the preferences of the players without specifying exact monetary benefits, where a payoff of 2 is more desirable than a payoff of 1, but is not necessarily twice as good.

-   When both choose to `hold`: Margins remain stable, leading to moderate gains for each, scored as a 1.
-   When one `cuts` while the other `holds`: The startup that cuts price captures additional market share, earning a payoff of 2, while the other, maintaining its prices, faces a disadvantage, incurring a payoff of -2.
-   When both decide to `cut`: a price war ensues, diminishing profits for both parties, reflected by payoffs of -1 each.

Armed with an understanding of the players, their possible actions, and the associated payoffs, we're equipped to layout the game in a normal form matrix:

![Players, actions, and payoffs of the startup pricing (prisoner's dilemma) game.](images/PD-entrep-1.png){#fig-pd-1 .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}

In this representation:

-   The "row player" (Startup A), shown in blue, faces the decision to `hold` or `cut` prices.
-   Similarly, the "column player" (Startup B), illustrated in green, navigates the same choices.
-   The matrix delineates the ordinal payoffs for Startup A (row player) in the bottom left of each cell and for Startup B (column player) in the upper right, corresponding to every possible action pairing.

This visual and structured approach to defining the game scenario illuminates the strategic interplay at hand, setting the stage for further analysis to discern optimal strategies and anticipate potential equilibrium outcomes.

#### Step 4: Identify Player Strategies {.unnumbered}

In game theory, a player's *strategy* encompasses the suite of actions they would select as their *best response* to every potential move their competitor might make. An action qualifies as a best response when it secures the highest payoff among the available options.

For Startup A, strategic decisions hinge on Startup B's pricing actions:

-   If Startup B opts to `hold` its prices, Startup A can maximize its benefit by `cutting` its own prices. This aggressive pricing strategy yields a higher payoff of 2, as opposed to the moderate gain of 1 that comes with maintaining price levels.

-   If Startup B `cuts` its prices, Startup A finds its most favorable outcome (-1) in reciprocating the price `cut`, aligning with Startup B's aggressive strategy.

Startup A's strategic pattern can be visually represented using directional arrows pointing towards actions yielding the highest payoffs, based on Startup B's decisions.[^1] As illustrated in @fig-pd-2, both arrows for Startup A direct towards a price `cut`, indicating a strategy for Startup A to always opt for a price reduction, irrespective of Startup B's choice.[^2]

[^1]: There are many ways to represent normal form games and their payoffs and strategies. None seems to be be completely superior. Thomas Schelling, 2005 Nobel prize winner in economics, introduced this method of placing payoffs in the corners of each cell and using arrows to describe best responses. The best-response arrows are cousins to the reaction functions we saw in Bertrand oligopolies.

[^2]: When the best response of one player is always the same action, like Startup A choosing to `cut` price in both cases, that player has a **dominant strategy**.

![Startup A's strategy in the (prisoner's dilemma) pricing game -- `cut` if Startup B chooses `hold` and `cut` if Startup B chooses `cut`.](images/PD-entrep-2.png){#fig-pd-2 .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Startup B's strategy mirrors this approach:

- Facing a price `hold` from Startup A, Startup B's advantageous move is to `cut` prices.
- Similarly, when Startup A `cuts` prices, Startup B's best strategy remains to `cut`, maintaining competitive parity.

This analysis reveals a pivotal insight: both startups are inclined towards a dominant strategy of price reduction under all circumstances, setting the stage for a potential price war. This is a normal form representation of undifferentiated Bertrand competition that eventually descends into price wars and zero profits.  Such a scenario underscores the strategic intricacies inherent in competitive markets, where anticipating and countering the moves of rivals can define the contours of business success.


#### Step 5: Solve for Equilibrium {.unnumbered}

The **Nash equilibrium**[^3] is the strategic point where all players in a game settle on choices that leave them with no incentive to pursue a different course of action, provided that every other player remains constant in their strategy. This state of mutual best responses occurs when each player's strategy is the best they can opt for, considering the strategies chosen by their competitors.

[^3]: John Nash won a Nobel prize in economic sciences for his research on the problem of bargaining over the value created through cooperation [@nash50]. If a group collaborates to create new value, how should they split the value? Nash overcame the mathematical “indeterminacy” that was a roadblock to earlier mathematicians by focusing on individuals that choose their best response to the choices of others [@nash51].

The game's matrix, illustrated in @fig-pd-3, highlights strategies through arrows pointing towards actions that garner the highest payoffs. The Nash Equilibrium is achieved when both startups opt to reduce prices, a strategy represented by arrows converging on the cut/cut decision. This scenario not only instigates a price war, diminishing profits for both entities but also exemplifies a dominant strategies equilibrium, where each firm's unilateral decision to cut prices reflects the optimal response to the anticipated action of the other.

![The Nash Equilibrium in this entrepreneurial pricing game arises at `cut`/`cut`, signifying simultaneous best responses leading to potentially suboptimal collective outcomes.](images/PD-entrep-3.png){#fig-pd-3 .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}

This real-world rendition of the Prisoner's Dilemma epitomizes a broader class of strategic games where players, driven by dominant strategies, inadvertently converge on outcomes that might not serve their collective best interests. Through this lens, the dilemma doesn't just offer a theoretical exercise but rather a practical reflection on the dynamics of competitive strategy, underscoring the critical importance of strategic foresight and the potential consequences of uncoordinated competitive aggression.


#### Practical Application: Navigating Competitive Strategy {.unnumbered}

The Prisoner's Dilemma isn't just a theoretical concept; it's a vivid illustration of the strategic decisions entrepreneurs face daily. It highlights the importance of considering both the immediate impact of your actions and how competitors might respond.

Aggressive strategies, like price cuts, may offer quick wins but understanding the broader dynamics of competition can guide you towards strategies that ensure long-term market stability and profitability.

Mastering game theory's principles, as demonstrated through the Prisoner's Dilemma and its Nash equilibrium, empowers entrepreneurs to:

- __Forecast Competitor Behavior:__ Identifying dominant strategies helps predict competitor moves, giving you a strategic edge.
- __Look Beyond the Short Term:__ It encourages strategies that safeguard against potential market disruptions, favoring sustainable success.
- __Find Collaboration Opportunities:__ Understanding mutual dependencies can reveal partnerships that amplify your competitive advantage.
- __Clarify Decision-Making:__ Game theory models offer a clear visual framework to assess strategies and their outcomes, making complex decisions more manageable.




### Strategic Partnerships and Multiple Equilibria {#sec-partnerships}

The dynamics of strategic partnerships often mirror those found in coordination games, characterized by the presence of multiple equilibria. These scenarios challenge firms to make decisions that not only serve their own interests but are also critical for the collective success of the alliance.

Imagine two startups, each with its own specialized technology, considering a strategic alliance. The effectiveness of their partnership is contingent on selecting operational standards or development trajectories that are mutually compatible. This decision-making process is akin to navigating a coordination game, where the most favorable outcomes are achieved through synchronized choices.

#### Identifying the Players and Actions {.unnumbered}

The players in this scenario are:

-   Startup A, with a specialization in software development,
-   Startup B, specializing in hardware production.

Their actions involve choosing between two operational standards or development paths: `Standard X` or `Standard Y`.

#### Determining Payoffs {.unnumbered}

The payoffs reflect the compatibility of operational standards and the synergy effect on the partnership:

-   Both choose `Standard X`: High compatibility and synergy, leading to significant mutual benefits.
-   Both choose `Standard Y`: Similar to `X`, but with nuances that slightly favor Startup B's hardware orientation.
-   Disparate choices lead to compatibility issues, diminishing the potential benefits of the partnership.

#### Constructing the Game in Normal Form {.unnumbered}

The game matrix, visualized in @fig-coordination-a, elucidates the outcomes based on the combinations of choices by the startups.

![Construction of the partnership coordination game.](images/Coordination-1.png){#fig-coordination-a .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}


#### Strategy and Equilibria {.unnumbered}

In this partnership game, both startups aim to align on a standard, understanding that compatibility maximizes the partnership's value. The game is solved in @fig-coordination-b where the presence of multiple Nash equilibria reflects the possible outcomes where each startup's choice complements the other's, ensuring mutual benefit.

![Strategies and equilibrium outcome.](images/Coordination-2.png){#fig-coordination-b .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}

#### Application to Strategic Partnerships {.unnumbered}

The presence of multiple equilibria in such a strategic decision-making context underscores the need for mechanisms that can guide the startups toward a single, mutually beneficial equilibrium. This could involve pre-negotiation agreements, shared vision sessions, or adopting a sequential decision-making approach where one startup's choice informs the other's decision, akin to moves in a sequential game.

Such strategies not only help align the startups' decisions but also build a foundation for trust and cooperation, essential elements for the success of any strategic partnership. By effectively navigating these coordination challenges, startups can leverage their alliance as a competitive advantage, driving innovation and capturing greater market share.

Strategic partnerships, through the lens of game theory, reveal the complexities and opportunities inherent in collaboration. By understanding and applying the principles of coordination games, firms can more effectively navigate the intricacies of partnership dynamics, steering towards decisions that enhance both their individual prospects and collective success.



### Navigating Uncertainty with Mixed Strategies: Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock-paper-scissors, beyond being a childhood game, exemplifies strategic decisions in scenarios lacking a clear Nash Equilibrium. This game illustrates that sometimes, business strategies don’t lead to straightforward outcomes and that embracing flexibility and unpredictability can be advantageous.

#### Constructing the Game {.unnumbered}

In constructing payoffs for rock-paper-scissors, we use ordinal payoffs to signify preferences rather than exact values. For instance, tying might have a payoff of 0, a win 1, and a loss -1, setting a baseline for evaluating outcomes. The formal game is represented in @fig-rps-a.

![Construction of the rock-paper-scissors game.](images/RPS-01.png){#fig-rps-a .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}


#### Solving the Game {.unnumbered}

The solution to the rock-paper-scissors game is given in @fig-rps-b with curious results. The strategies of both players are not hard to find but there is no Nash equilibrium. Analysis reveals no single strategy guarantees a win, because there is every cell has an arrow leaving meaning that there is no outcome that is simultaneously a best response for both players. When you build and solve bespoke games for your context, you may not find a _pure strategies equilibrium_.

![Strategies with no Nash equilibrium outcome that can be shown in normal form.](images/RPS-02.png){#fig-rps-b .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}

#### Mixed-strategies Equilibrium {.unnumbered}

When the game has no Nash equilibrium, you may turn to the concept of mixed-strategies, randomizing decisions for direction in decision-making.  The problem for players of rock-paper-scissors is that any action can be countered with an action that will always win. It doesn't take long for players (often children)  to learn that they must randomize their choice or they will always lose. If they place $\mathsf{\frac{1}{3}}$ probability on each choice to avoid predictability, they will lose one-third of the games, win one-third, and tie one-third. 

This approach is a _mixed-strategy_ and leads to a _mixed-strategies equilibrium_.  It does not tell you what action to take but it does help you choose randomization.  The equilibrium does not allow us to predict the outcome that will happen but it does predict the the probability of any outcome. This is an equilibrium because no player has an incentive to deviate.

This approach underscores the importance of adaptability and the potential to incorporate randomness into strategic planning, especially in highly competitive or uncertain markets.




## Build Custom Games

Diving into the practical application of game theory, we aim to equip you with the ability to craft and solve games tailored to the unique strategic challenges of your business environment. This approach ensures that insights are directly applicable, guiding you toward informed strategic decisions in real scenarios."

A pivotal step in applying game theory is defining payoffs—the outcomes of strategic decisions. We'll explore both ordinal and cardinal payoffs: ordinal payoffs simplify strategic preferences without specific values, offering a clear view of options, while cardinal payoffs provide a detailed, quantitative analysis of decisions' impacts. By mastering these methods, you'll be equipped to use game theory effectively, leveraging strategic insights for competitive advantage.



### Ordinal Payoffs: A Logical Approach {.unnumbered}

Identifying payoffs is a crucial yet challenging step in game theory, particularly when the strategic scenario defines players and actions clearly, but payoffs remain ambiguous. For _ordinal payoffs_, the key is to ensure they represent a clear ranking of outcomes without necessitating specific values or units. Start by selecting a baseline scenario and assigning payoffs that mirror the expected order of preferences. For instance, in a rock-paper-scissors game, a tie scenario like Rock/Rock might be assigned a payoff of 0/0. This sets a foundation to then value a win at one point and a loss at negative one, simplifying the construction of the game matrix based on these relative rankings.

Ordinal payoffs expedite game building by sidestepping detailed financial calculations, provided they accurately reflect the preference order. By methodically considering the relative merits of different strategic outcomes, you not only craft a clearer game structure but also enhance your strategic insights, enabling informed decision-making and predictable outcomes.


### Cardinal Payoffs: A Competition Analytics Approach {.unnumbered}

<!-- Ordinal payoffs house an implicit assumption that we know what will result from the chosen actions so we can set the order of our preferences.  It is often the case that we cannot determine the outcome or our preferences for it just from a thought experiment.  When the outcomes are ambiguous, we need a deeper understanding that we get from the profit analytics that run throughout this book.

When working with *cardinal payoffs*, it is best if they are computed profits that we calculate through analtyics.  They may be the profits from differentiated Bertrand competition in a one-shot game.  If the competition is repeated over time, the payoffs are constructed as the net present value (NPV) of the profits from Bertrand competition over time.  In other words, cardinal payoffs should include the total impact on the game throughout the time that the players are interdependent. -->

While ordinal payoffs rank outcomes based on preferences, cardinal payoffs require quantifiable insights often not evident through mere speculation. These payoffs, crucial for understanding the tangible outcomes of strategic choices, are derived from profit analytics. Whether it's profits from a one-time differentiated Bertrand competition or the net present value (NPV) of ongoing competitive profits, cardinal payoffs quantify the financial impact of decisions over the duration of interdependence between players. This depth of analysis, rooted in profit calculations, provides a comprehensive view of potential strategic outcomes.

#### A Demonstration Case of Airbus and Boeing Choosing to Develop a New Aircraft {.unnumbered}

#### Airbus vs. Boeing: A Demonstration of Cardinal Payoffs

Consider Airbus and Boeing, evaluating whether to develop a new, technologically advanced aircraft. This strategic decision is influenced by potential market responses, competitive actions, and financial implications. Here’s how we break down their game using cardinal payoffs derived from profit analytics.

__Players__: Airbus and Boeing

__Actions__: Each can either `Innovate` or `Not Innovate`.

__Payoffs__: Derived from a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, reflecting the net present value (NPV) of the calculated Bertrand oligopoly profits over 20 years. These are hypothetical yet realistic figures based on competitive analytics and demand forecasts:

- Both `not innovate`: Airbus NPV = \$30B; Boeing NPV = \$40B.
- Airbus `innovate`, Boeing `not innovate`: Airbus NPV = \$40B; Boeing NPV = \$20B.
- Boeing `innovate`, Airbus `not innovate`: Airbus NPV = \$20B; Boeing NPV = \$30B.
- Both `innovate`: Airbus NPV = -\$10B; Boeing NPV = -\$20B.

The determination of these payoffs involves extensive data collection and demand analysis. For instance, we estimate demand curves for each scenario, accounting for variable and fixed costs—including R&D investments. This process, while data-intensive, is crucial for major strategic decisions that could define the company's future.

__Strategies and Equilibrium:__

The game matrix, illustrated in @fig-airbus-boeing-2, reveals that Boeing has a dominant strategy not to innovate, allowing Airbus to launch the new aircraft and secure an enhanced competitive position in the advanced technology market.

![Construction and solution of a game in normal form where Airbus and Boeing decide whether to launch a new aircraft: Boeing has a dominant strategy not to launch so Airbus launches and profits from a newly achieved competitive advantage.](images/Airbus-Boeing-2.png){#fig-airbus-boeing-2 .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}

This example underscores the significance of grounding strategic decisions in solid analytics. While ordinal payoffs offer quick strategic insights, cardinal payoffs provide the depth necessary for high-stakes decision-making, ensuring strategies are not just intuitive but analytically sound.




<br>

## Sequential Games

Unlike the simultaneous games we've explored, many real-world strategic decisions unfold in a sequence rather than all at once. In sequential games, players make their moves one after another, allowing later players to react to the decisions of those who acted before them. This sequence of moving and responding fundamentally changes the game's dynamics and treating them like a simultaneous game leads to flawed strategies and disappointing outcomes.

In sequential games, the timing and order of decisions are not insignificant details. The ability to observe and react to a competitor's move can be a significant strategic advantage. The ability to anticipate a competitor's response allows players to move pre-emptively and shape the competitive environment in their favor.  Moving first, for example, allows a firm to make strategic commitments that can deter competitors, secure resources, or lock in advantageous positions by forcing competitors to respond to the early mover on less favorable terms.

In sequential games, the dynamics go beyond mere observation and response. They open up the possibility of __non-credible threats__, where a player might threaten to take actions that, upon closer inspection, wouldn't actually be in their interest to carry out. Such threats, lacking in credibility, should typically be ignored, as they're unlikely to be acted upon. Distinguishing between credible and non-credible strategies becomes a critical skill in navigating the strategic landscape of sequential games.

Thankfully, the challenge of identifying and countering non-credible threats can be systematically addressed by constructing the game in an __extensive form__ (essentially, a decision tree) and solving it through __backward induction__. This method for identifying strategies, simplifies the analysis by breaking down the game into a sequence of decisions to choose the best response, starting from the end and working backwards. By doing so, it becomes evident which threats or actions are actually in a player's interest to follow through on, based on the outcomes of subsequent moves.

This method not only clarifies which strategies are credible but also enhances strategic planning and decision-making. It allows entrepreneurs and strategists to anticipate competitor moves more accurately, devise responses that effectively counter non-credible threats, and leverage their own strategic moves for maximum impact. Through the use of extensive form games and backward induction, the complex interdependencies of sequential decisions become navigable, empowering businesses to craft strategies that are both informed and actionable.

--------------------

Consider a simple game where an entrepreneur deliberates entering a market dominated by a monopolist. The entrepreneur's choices are to enter or not enter, while the monopolist can fight the entry with aggressive pricing or accommodate by sharing the market. The outcomes are quantified as follows:

- `Enter` and `fight`: The entrepreneur faces a \$5M loss, while the monopolist gains \$4M.
- `Enter` and `accommodate`: Both parties profit by \$5M each.
- `Not enter`: Regardless of the monopolist’s choice, the entrepreneur gains nothing, and the monopolist secures a \$12M profit.

Solving this game in normal form reveals two Nash equilibria seen in @fig-monop-entrant-1: one where the monopolist fights and deters entry, and another where the entrant enters and is accommodated. But which outcome is more likely?

![If the entry game is played simultaneously in normal form, the solution is two Nash equilibria where the monopolist may fight or accommodate and the entrant may enter or not enter.](images/Monop-Entrant-02.png){#fig-monop-entrant-1 .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Given the logical sequence of moves, the entrant must decide first, providing the monopolist with something to fight or accommodate. This sequential decision-making highlights the non-credibility of the monopolist's threat to fight. If the entrant chooses to enter, knowing the monopolist’s best interest lies in accommodating, the threat of a price war becomes ineffective. This realization negates the not enter/fight equilibrium, leaving enter/accommodate as the most plausible outcome.

The crux of sequential games is recognizing that threats lacking in credibility—those not in a player's best interest to execute—should not influence decision-making. The sequencing of moves clarifies which strategies are bluffs and which are genuine, guiding players towards rational and beneficial outcomes. This principle is pivotal in strategic environments where timing and order of actions shape the competitive landscape, enabling players to navigate complex scenarios with foresight and precision.


#### Constructing Sequential Games in Extensive Form {.unnumbered}

When dealing with sequential-move games, particularly those with multiple stages, constructing them in __extensive form__ enhances clarity. This format visualizes the game as a decision tree, where nodes represent decision points for players, and branches indicate possible actions.

For illustration, let's revisit the monopolist-entrant game, now depicted in extensive form as seen in @fig-monop-entrant-a. In this decision tree:

- "E" marks the entrant’s decision node: to `enter` or `not enter`.
- "M" nodes represent the monopolist’s subsequent choices: to `fight` by initiating a price war or to `accommodate` by maintaining high prices and sharing the market.

The payoffs, aligned with our previous discussion in normal form, are noted at each terminal node, reflecting the outcomes of combined actions. The arrangement of payoffs (whether on the left or right) should maintain consistency and clear labeling to avoid confusion.

![Construction of the entry game with sequential moves in extensive form: "E" is the entrant, "M" is the monopolist, their possible actions are marked on the paths, and their payoffs are given at the end of each decision path.](images/Monopolist-Entrant-a.png){#fig-monop-entrant-a .lightbox fig-align="center" width="50%"}



#### Solving Sequential Games Through Backward Induction {.unnumbered}

To solve sequential games in extensive form, we use a method known as __backward induction__, which clarifies the decision-making process by working from the game's end back to its start. This method helps us pinpoint the best response at each decision point, considering the subsequent moves of other players.

Returning to our monopolist-entrant game in extensive form, we start with the monopolist's final decisions. Given the choice between a price war and maintaining high prices after the entrant has entered, the monopolist prefers the latter, yielding a higher payoff. This preference is represented in @fig-monop-entrant-b by a bolded arrow towards the high price decision, indicating the monopolist's best response.  When the entrant does not enter, we move to the lower node for the monopolist where it retains monopoly status regardless of whether if fights or accommodates.

![Solving the entry game in extensive form through backward induction: best responses are indicated by bolded arrows, leading to the sub-game perfect equilibrium.](images/Monopolist-Entrant-b.png){#fig-monop-entrant-b .lightbox fig-align="center" width="55%"}

The entrant, considering the monopolist's response, finds entering the market to be the best move, given it leads to a mutually beneficial profit sharing. This decision path is marked, leading to the game's equilibrium point, where both firms play their best responses simultaneously.

The key outcome of backward induction is the __sub-game perfect equilibrium__, which inherently discounts non-credible threats. Unlike in our initial normal form game, where the monopolist's threat of a price war might deter entry, sequential analysis reveals such threats as non-credible. The monopolist, in reality, would choose to accommodate entry, rendering the price war strategy implausible when actions unfold over time.

Thus, the sub-game perfect equilibrium identified through backward induction is a refined Nash equilibrium specific to sequential games.^[All sub-game perfect equilibria are Nash equilibria but the inverse is not true.] It focuses on credible strategies by considering the actual sequence of moves, ensuring that only feasible outcomes—those based on rational, best-response strategies—are considered viable. In doing so, it sidesteps the ambiguity of non-credible threats found in simultaneous-move games, offering a clear pathway to strategic decision-making in real-world scenarios.




<br>

## Strategic Commitment

Chances are that you were confused with the sub-game perfect equilibrium outcome of the sequential game between the monopolist and the entrant. Monopolists do not have the reputation of welcoming new entrants with open arms, otherwise there would have been no need for antitrust laws and prosecution. Why isn't the monopolist in our entry game stronger?

The reason is simply because we haven't yet given it the opportunity to move before the entrant. More specifically, the monopolist failed to deter entry because its threat of starting a price war was not credible. The price war was not credible because the payoff of a price war was less than the payoff of sharing the market with the entrant at a high price. The monopolist seems weak in this game because it is unable to _commit_ to a price war.

__Strategic commitment__ is a powerful concept in business strategy that enables a firm to shape the competitive landscape to its advantage. At its core, strategic commitment involves making a decisive move that changes the game's dynamics, influencing competitors' actions and improving the firm's position. This move could be an investment, a product launch, or any action that commits the firm to a specific strategy.

The essence of strategic commitment lies in the concept of "burning bridges," where a firm deliberately limits its future options to signal its determination and change the course of competition. This could mean, for example, that a monopolist cutting costs by moving down the learning curve can reduce the costs of a price war, allowing a credible commitment that may deterring potential entrants from competing.


For a strategic commitment to be effective, it must be:

- __Visible__: Competitors must be aware of the action to be influenced by it.
- __Understandable__: The strategic intent behind the action must be clear to competitors.
- __Credible__: Competitors must believe that the firm will follow through on its commitment.
- __Irreversible__: The action cannot be easily undone, ensuring the commitment's credibility.

Irreversibility is critical; it cements the firm’s commitment and forces competitors to respond accordingly. This is where the distinction between sunk costs and recoverable fixed costs becomes important. Sunk costs, once incurred, cannot be recovered and thus embody the firm's commitment to its chosen strategy.^[This is where the application of the definition of sunk costs differs between fields of management. All fields agree that sunk costs are those that have been incurred and cannot be recovered. In accounting, fixed costs that can be recovered in the future but have not yet been recovered, legally cannot be subtracted from the fixed costs. If and when the fixed cost is recovered, it will be dealt with in a new journal entry. In finance, when doing cash flow analysis before an investment, the capital outlay would not be reduced by the possibility of selling the asset at a later date. If and when the asset is sold, it would show up in the salvage value calculations at the end of the time horizon. In these cases, fixed costs and sunk costs are the same.] 
When a position can be easily and rationally reversed, the competitor will expect it to be reversed so it is not credible. When we seek to change the nature of the game through strategic commitment, threats must be credible; there can be no possibility of reversing our position.

Strategic commitment can reshape competitive dynamics by making certain competitor actions (such as entering a market or starting a price war) less attractive or even untenable. It's about creating a competitive edge by shaping the strategic choices available to your rivals in a way that favors your firm.

In practical terms, strategic commitment might involve investing in specialized assets that serve a particular market segment, thereby signaling a long-term commitment to that segment. Or it might involve adopting technologies that set new industry standards, making it harder for competitors to offer alternative solutions. Each of these actions, by its nature, changes the competitive landscape and can help secure a more advantageous position for the firm.


In the game where a monopolist faces the possibility of new entrants, strategic commitment can play a crucial role in deterring entry and maintaining a competitive advantage. One effective, and legal, way for a monopolist to commit to fierce competition with an entrant is to invest in moving down the learning curve to reduce variable costs below the costs of a potential entrant who has no history to learn from. This approach involves improving operational efficiency to reduce variable costs, allowing the monopolist to set prices low enough to deter entry while still maintaining profitable margins.

By investing in technologies, processes, or practices that enhance efficiency, a monopolist can ensure its costs are continually decreasing. This strategic commitment to operational excellence becomes visible and credible to potential entrants. They recognize the monopolist's cost advantage and the consequent ability to compete aggressively on price, making entry less attractive.

The opportunity for the monopolist to invest in enhanced efficiency and lower costs adds to the entry game.  We add an earlier stage where the monopolist must decide whether to "invest" in strategic commitment by investing in efficiency and learning. If it does not invest, the game is unchanged; if it does, the monopolist's payoffs change.  After investment, the payoff of a price war increases from \$4M to \$8M. This new game, with its attempted strategic commitment, is constructed and solved in @fig-monop-entrant-c.

Another powerful form of strategic commitment is investing in branding. A strong brand creates a differentiated customer experience that new entrants cannot easily replicate. Brand loyalty acts as a barrier to entry by requiring new entrants to not only match but significantly exceed the monopolist's value proposition to gain customer attention. This necessitates substantial investments in marketing and product development from the entrant, raising the cost and risk of entry.

Both moving down the learning curve and building a strong brand are strategic commitments that change the competitive game. They alter the payoffs for potential entrants, making it clear that entering the market would not yield the expected returns. These strategies are both visible and irreversible—investments in efficiency and brand equity cannot be quickly undone, and their effects persist over time, reinforcing the monopolist's competitive position.

In summary, strategic commitment through operational efficiency and branding provides a clear, ethical, and legally sound path for firms to deter potential entrants and secure their market position. By making these strategic investments, firms not only enhance their own competitive advantage but also reshape the competitive landscape in their favor.

## Conclusion

Throughout this chapter, we've journeyed through the intricate landscape of game theory, unraveling how strategic interdependence underpins the competitive and cooperative dynamics of the business decisions Starting with the foundational concepts of simultaneous games, we've explored the pivotal roles of actions, strategies, payoffs, and equilibrium in shaping the outcomes of entrepreneurial ventures. Moving beyond the simultaneity of decisions, sequential games introduced us to the complexities of timing, revealing how the sequence of moves can dramatically alter strategic advantages and the credibility of commitments.

Strategic commitment, as we've seen, stands as a beacon for entrepreneurs seeking not just to navigate but to sculpt the competitive terrain to their advantage. Whether through operational efficiency, branding, or other forms of strategic investments, the deliberate, visible, and irreversible actions taken today can deter potential competitors tomorrow, securing a more favorable position in the market landscape.

Game theory offers more than just a theoretical framework; it provides a lens through which entrepreneurs can critically analyze and refine their strategic decisions. It teaches us the value of anticipating the moves of others, understanding the depth of strategic interdependence, and the power of committing to a course of action that reshapes the playing field in our favor.

As entrepreneurs, the application of game theory extends beyond academic exercises. It challenges us to think deeply about the strategies we deploy, the signals we send to the market, and the commitments we make to secure our place within it. By mastering these principles, we can turn strategic insights into competitive advantages, navigate complex market dynamics with confidence, and drive our ventures toward sustainable success.

Uncertainty often prevails in entrepreneurship but game theory stands as a guide, illuminating paths through the competitive fog. It empowers us to craft strategies that are not only individually rational but collectively advantageous, steering our ventures toward outcomes where innovation, cooperation, and strategic foresight lead the way to victory.

## Workout Problems

1.  Several years ago, college football programs began evaluating upgrades to their workout and training facilities as a means to recruit better athletes. Better facilities were shown to improve the likelihood that a recruit would sign. When some top recruits signed with less prestigious schools with better facilities, rival programs were enticed to invest in upgrades to improve their recruiting. With better athletes, performance improves on the field which improves ticket sales and donations.

    Assume that BYU and the University of Utah (the U) are the only schools recruiting a particular group of athletes---this is wrong but it dramatically simplifies the game. If neither school invests in facilities, the annual return to the sports department is \$20M for BYU and \$15M for the U. If BYU invests but the U does not, BYU earns \$25M and the U earns \$7M. If the U invests but BYU does not, BYU earns \$15M and the U earns \$25M. If both invest, they get the same recruits they had in the past but must pay for the facilities to do it such that BYU earns \$17M and the U earns \$12M. Construct and solve the normal form game.

    a.  Which schools have a dominant strategy?
    b.  What is BYU's strategy?
    c.  What is the equilibrium outcome?

2.  Suppose there are two existing firms in the market for baby monitors. Firm A knows how to reduce the production costs for the monitor and is considering whether to adopt the innovation or not. Innovation incurs a fixed set-up cost of $\mathsf{F}$, while increasing the revenue. However, once the new technology is adopted, another firm, B, can adopt it with a smaller set-up cost of $\mathsf{\frac{F}{2}}$. If A innovates and B does not, A earns \$20 in revenue while B earns \$0. If A innovates and B does likewise, both firms earn \$15 in revenue. If neither firm innovates, both earn \$5.

    a.  Hypothesizing that Firm A will innovate, the set-up cost of the innovation (\mathsf{F}\$) has to be below what value for Firm B to want to adopt? <!-- less than $30 -->
    b.  Given your answer in the previous question, the set-up cost of the innovation ($\mathsf{F}$) has to be below what value for Firm A to want to adopt? <!--  less than $10 -->
    c.  If $\mathsf{C = 15}$, what is the sub-game perfect equilibrium of the game?

3.  Firm M is an existing firm in a market and firm E is a potential entrant. Firm E must decide whether to enter the market (play "enter") or stay out of the market (play "not enter"). If firm E decides to enter the market, firm M must decide whether to engage in a price war (play "hardball"), or not (play "softball"). By playing "hardball", firm M ensures that firm E makes a loss of \$1 million, but firm M only makes \$1 million in profits. On the other hand, if firm M plays "softball", the new entrant takes half of the market, and each firm earns profits of \$5 million. If firm E stays out, it earns zero while firm M earns \$12 million.

    a.  What is the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of this game?

    Feeling vulnerable, firm M is considering investing in market share to move down its learning curve more quickly. With lower costs, firm M is more effective at playing "hard" but less profitable in its normal operations due to cost of the investment. The payoffs of this game are as follows, with Firm M's payoffs on the left and Firm E's payoffs on the right:

    b.  What is the sub-game perfect equilibrium after considering investment in M's learning curve?
    c.  Should firm M make the investment? (Yes or No)
