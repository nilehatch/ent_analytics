# Estimate Fixed Costs as Commitments {#sec-toolkit-fixed-cost-chapter .unnumbered}

#### *What You Commit to Before Knowing What Will Sell*

This toolkit supports one narrow but critical task:

> *Making fixed cost commitments explicit—well enough to reason about exposure and risk.*

The goal is not to predict expenses precisely.  
The goal is to understand what you are committing to *before* demand is known.

Early ventures rarely fail because fixed costs were miscalculated by a few percent.  
They fail because commitments were made implicitly, too early, or without recognizing their consequences.

This toolkit exists to surface those commitments deliberately.

::: {.callout-note title="How this toolkit fits" icon=false collapse=true}
This toolkit is a practical companion to [Chapter 9: Cost](ch9_cost.qmd).  
It helps you surface fixed cost commitments—the obligations that shape exposure, break-even, and downside risk in profit reasoning and in the [Profit Analytics app](https://rconnect.byu.edu/ProfitAnalytics).

The goal is not accounting accuracy.  
The goal is decision-grade feasibility.

## What This Toolkit Is (and Is Not)

This toolkit is about **commitment**, not accounting.

It does not assume:

- that fixed costs are permanent,
- that they are unavoidable,
- or that they must be minimized at all costs.

It does assume that:

- some costs are triggered by *your decision to proceed*, not by customer purchases,
- those costs create exposure when demand disappoints,
- and reversing them is often slow, costly, or impossible.

This toolkit helps you see those commitments clearly—*before* they bind.



## The Core Question

Every fixed cost estimate begins with a different question than variable cost:

> *What do I have to commit to before knowing how many customers will buy?*

If a cost is incurred because a customer buys, it is not fixed.  
If a cost is incurred because *you decided to move forward*, it probably is.

This distinction matters more than accounting labels, because it determines *who bears the risk* when demand falls short.



## Fixed Cost Is About Commitments, Not Categories

In accounting, fixed costs are defined mechanically.

For decision-making, a more useful definition is this:

> *A fixed cost is any cost you incur because you decided to proceed, regardless of how many units are sold.*

What matters most is not whether a cost is technically fixed forever, but whether it is:

- difficult to reverse,
- slow to unwind,
- or binding over the relevant decision horizon.

To surface these commitments, the sections below describe **common ways fixed costs enter a venture**.

These are *commitment mechanisms*, not requirements.

If a mechanism does not apply, leave it blank.

*Blank means “not committed,” not “overlooked.”*



## Common Fixed Cost Commitment Triggers

The categories below are prompts designed to surface exposure—not to force costs where they do not belong.


### 1. Capacity Commitments

> *What capacity am I building before demand is known?*

Examples include:

- salaried labor,
- facilities or office space,
- server capacity or infrastructure,
- equipment, vehicles, or tooling.

Many capacity costs are **step-fixed**:

- they support demand up to a limit,
- then require another commitment to grow further.

These costs are fixed over the relevant range—even if they scale in steps.


### 2. Access and Channel Commitments

> *What access do I pay for in advance?*

Examples include:

- distribution agreements,
- platform or marketplace access,
- compliance requirements,
- certifications or regulatory approvals.

These costs do not depend on how many customers buy.  
They depend on whether you choose to play.


### 3. Capability Commitments

> *What capabilities must exist before I can sell at all?*

Examples include:

- internal systems and tooling,
- software subscriptions (including AI),
- brand development,
- intellectual property filings.

These costs are often rationalized as “investments.”  
They are still commitments.


### 4. Time-Bound Commitments

> *What am I locked into for a period of time?*

Examples include:

- leases,
- employment contracts,
- minimum service agreements,
- insurance premiums.

Time is often the binding constraint—not dollars.  
A short-term commitment may be far less risky than a long one at the same cost.


### 5. Foundational Compensation and Overhead

> *Who gets paid even if nothing sells?*

Examples include:

- founder compensation,
- executive or management salaries,
- benefits and payroll overhead,
- legal and administrative support.

Omitting these costs does not make them disappear.  
It only hides the exposure.



## A Discipline for Surfacing Commitments

One effective way to practice this discipline is to keep a working commitment table.

This is not a budget.  
It is a thinking aid.

Columns might represent:

- commitment triggers (like the categories above),
- and rows the specific commitments you believe you are making.

For each commitment, record:

- an estimate or range,
- the timing of the commitment,
- and how reversible it is.

Some commitments may be clear.  
Others may be fuzzy or conditional.

That is fine.

The danger is not uncertainty.  
The danger is pretending a commitment does not exist.

If a category does not apply, leave it blank—and say why.


### Example: A Working Fixed Cost Commitment Table (Illustrative)

The table below shows one way to surface fixed cost commitments.  
It is not complete, correct, or prescriptive.  
Its purpose is to make exposure visible.

| Commitment Category | Cost Element | Estimate (per period) | Reversibility | Notes |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Capacity | Core team salaries | \$45k / month | Low | Hard to unwind quickly |
| Capacity | Cloud infrastructure (base) | \$6k / month | Medium | Can downscale slowly |
| Access | Regulatory certification | \$80k (one-time) | None | Required to operate |
| Capability | Software subscriptions | \$1.2k / month | High | Cancelable |
| Time-Bound | Office lease | \$3.5k / month | Low | 12-month lock-in |
| Compensation | Founder pay | — | — | Deferred by choice |

Some entries are monthly.  
Some are one-time.  
Some are blank.

That is intentional.

Blank means *not committed*, not *forgotten*.



## From Commitments to Decision-Grade Fixed Cost

This table is not meant to produce a single “correct” fixed cost number.

Its purpose is to clarify exposure—so you can see:

- which commitments dominate risk,
- which are hardest to reverse,
- and which can be delayed until uncertainty is reduced.

A fixed cost estimate becomes *decision-grade* when you can reasonably answer three questions:

- Which commitments create the greatest exposure if demand disappoints?
- Which commitments are hardest to reverse?
- Which commitments can be delayed without undermining learning?

At this stage, understanding *irreversibility* matters more than minimizing cost.



## Common Red Flags

If your fixed cost assessment feels optimistic, pause.

Common warning signs include:

- assuming founder or executive labor is “free,”
- ignoring the duration of commitments,
- treating compliance or access costs as minor,
- assuming scale will arrive before commitments bind.

These are not errors of intent.  
They are predictable blind spots.

This toolkit exists to surface them early—before they become irreversible.



## Why This Matters for Profit Reasoning

Fixed costs determine how much demand must exist *before* profit becomes possible.

They create thresholds, break-even points, and exposure to error.  
They are the primary source of downside risk in early ventures.

Estimating fixed costs carefully does not eliminate uncertainty.  
But estimating them implicitly guarantees surprise.

Once fixed commitments are explicit, profit reasoning can honestly assess whether the expected rewards justify the exposure.

That is the role fixed cost plays in the pre-revenue decision.
