  author={Adner, Ron},
  journal={Strategic Management Journal},
  volume={23},

  pages={667--688},
  year={2002},
  publisher={Wiley Online Library},
  abstract={By identifying the possibility that technologies with inferior performance can displace established incumbents, the notion of disruptive technologies, pioneered by Christensen (1997), has had a profound effect on the way in which scholars and managers approach technology competition. While the phenomenon of disruptive technologies has been well documented, the underlying theoretical drivers of technology disruption are less well understood. This article identifies the demand conditions that enable disruptive dynamics. By examining how consumers evaluate technology and how this evaluation changes as performance improves, it offers new theoretical insight into the impact of the structure of the demand environment on competitive dynamics. Two new constructs?preference overlap and preference symmetry?are introduced to characterize the relationships among the preferences of different market segments. The article presents a formal model that examines how these relationships lead to the emergence of different competitive regimes. The model is analyzed using computer simulation. The theory and model results hold implications for understanding the dynamics of disruptive technologies and suggest new indicators for assessing disruptive threats. }

  abstract={This study examines the impact of localized competition on rates of failure in the Manhattan hotel industry from 1898 to 1990. The study investigates whether the organizations in a population with more similar resource requirements compete more intensely. This approach builds on existing density-based models of interorganizational competition by including variation at the organizational level directly in both the model and measures of competition. A dynamic analysis shows that hotels located in densely populated regions of the distributions of organizational size, geographic location, and price experienced significantly higher failure rates. The findings show how an ecological approach to competition that incorporates intrapopulation variation can provide a more detailed understanding of the competitive dynamics and evolution of organizational populations.},

  abstract={We investigate two non-traditional harvest strategies for selling a privately-held company. Dual-track private firms file for an IPO while also courting acquirers. These firms withdraw the IPO to be taken over. Dual-track public firms complete an IPO and are taken over shortly thereafter. Examining 679 takeovers from 1995?2004, we find private dual-track sell-outs earn a 22--26\% higher premium and dual-track public sell-outs earn an 18--21\% higher premium than single-track sell-outs. Larger, VC-backed, prestigious underwritten, and bubble-year firms have a higher propensity to take the dual-track path. The implication is that entrepreneurs may increase their harvest value by using a dual-track strategy.},

  abstract={The effects of strategic order of entry on firms' performance have long been an issue in many areas of study. Past research efforts, however, have been concentrated mostly on first mover or early entrant advantages. To contribute to developing a theory of latecomer strategies, the authors investigate how latecomers compete successfully or even leapfrog early movers. They review previous studies on early mover advantages and disadvantages, and group the sources of such advantages or disadvantages into three areas: the firm, its market, and its competitors. The theoretical focus is how a firm converts the opportunities stemming from entry order into performance. The authors seek to confirm and extend relevant theories by examining how late entrants have caught up with incumbent industry leaders in the global semiconductor industry. On the basis of in-depth case analysis of three Japanese and three Korean semiconductor companies, they identify and categorize successful latecomer strategies into two types: strategies for overcoming latecomer disadvantages and strategies for utilizing latecomer advantages. Focusing, thin margin or loss bearing, and volume building form the essence of strategies for overcoming disadvantages, whereas odd timing, time compression, human-embodied technology transfer, benchmarking, technological leapfrogging, and resource leveraging form the essence of strategies for utilizing advantages. Because many companies in Asia have had to face the reality of being latecomers, the Asian perspectives are particularly useful for studying and explicating latecomer strategies.},

The model describes four interpretation modes: enacting, discovering, undirected viewing, and conditioned viewing. Each mode is determined by (1) management's beliefs about the environment and (2) organizational intrusiveness. Interpretation modes are hypothesized to be associated with organizational differences in environmental scanning, equivocality reduction, strategy, and decision making.},

  volume={62},
  number={2},

  year={2008},
  abstract={It has been suggested that players often produce simplified and/or misspecified mental models of strategic decisions [Kreps, D., 1990. Game Theory and Economic Modeling. Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford]. We submit that the relational structure of players? preferences in a game is a source of cognitive complexity, and may be an important driver of such simplifications. We provide a classification of order structures in two- person games based on the properties of monotonicity and projectivity, and present experiments in which subjects construct representations of games of different relational complexity and subsequently play the games according to these representations. Experimental results suggest that relational complexity matters. More complex games are harder to represent, and this difficulty seems correlated with short term memory capacity. In addition, most erroneous representations are simpler than the correct ones. Finally, subjects who misrepresent the games behave consistently with such representations, suggesting that in many strategic settings individuals may act optimally on the ground of simplified and mistaken premises.},

  abstract={We explore the relationship between a firm's entry timing and its probability of surviving the early, uncertain period of its industry, and consider the trade-off between entering early and potentially establishing a strong position in the industry vs. waiting until technological uncertainty is reduced. We hypothesize that, owing to inertial forces, firms that enter the industry at the earliest point in its history are least likely to make the conversion to the product generation that becomes the dominant design in the industry. Exploration through the introduction of new products appears to reflect a local search process and retards the transition to the dominant design. We also hypothesize that, though firms entering early may exhibit longer life spans, their advantages are limited to the period before the emergence of the dominant design. We test our hypotheses in the early U.S. bicycle industry, and find evidence consistent with the idea that inertia limits firms' abilities to make the transition between generations of product configurations.},

  abstract={Research on managerial cognition in general, and on cognitive mapping in
 particular, is receiving a great deal of attention in Europe and the US, but the
 work being done is currently disparate and loosely coupled. Furthermore, the
 development of maps as a decision aid has tended to focus on specific
 sub-areas of cognition. In this article we argue that the broad strategic
 concerns of managers require a portfolio of different kinds of cognitive maps.
 The interactions among these maps are as important as the functions of each
 one separately. We develop a framework for classifying cognitive maps and
 argue for the importance of managing multiple maps.},

Our main finding is that first-mover advantages are best understood in tandem with the firm's technological capabilities; early entry is beneficial only for pioneers that are technically strong. However, pioneers that are low on technological capabilities suffer from poor survival rates vis--vis market responders or nonentrants into new product generations.},

  abstract={Much of the literature dedicated to the analysis of entry timing decisions has been devoted to the study of their consequences in terms of performance. However, only a limited amount of effort has been dedicated to analyzing the factors that determine these decisions. In addition, previous papers have centered their efforts on the product dimension, paying no attention to entry into new geographical markets. This paper departs from previous works in this respect and extends the entry timing literature through a consideration of the geographical side of entry. Our analysis shows that organizational size, organizational competence, and organizational experience appear as key factors when explaining the pattern of geographic diversification. Our results also indicate that diversification takes place sequentially, first proceeding to closer locations, then occupying markets further from the origin.

    abstract = {This paper focuses on the role of managerial cognition as a source of heterogeneity in firm strategies and performance. We link differences in mental models to differences in decision rules and performance in a management simulation. Our results show more accurate mental models lead to better decision rules and higher performance. We also find that decision makers do not need accurate knowledge of the entire business environment; accurate mental models of the key principles are sufficient to achieve superior performance. A fundamental assumption in much of strategic management is that managers who have a richer understanding about organizational capabilities and the dynamics of industry structure can improve the performance of their firms. Our findings provide empirical evidence supporting this assumption and show that differences in mental models help explain ex ante why managers and firms adopt different strategies and achieve different levels of competitive success.}

  abstract={Recent research suggests that managers often make strategic decisions in novel situations by utilizing past experiences to reason by analogy. However, there is substantial evidence that decision makers often fail to identify and apply knowledge about one situation to a similarly structured situation. Two experimental studies investigated the mechanisms impacting knowledge transfer from one managerial situation (the source) to an analogous situation. The results show that exposure to variation in the source situation improves transfer performance. Variation decreases performance in the short term but improves learning and increases analogical transfer. Higher performance on and systematic search of the source situation also increase transfer performance. These results yield important implications for enhancing analogical transfer in strategic decision making and for future research on reasoning by analogy.},

  %  abstract = {We used computer simulations to examine the role and interrelationship between search processes that are forward-looking, based on actors'  cognitive map of action-outcome linkages, and those that are backward-looking, or experience based. Cognition was modeled as a simple, low-dimensional representation of a more complex, higher dimensional fitness landscape. Results show that, although crude, these representations still act	as a powerful guide to initial search efforts and usefully constrain the direction of subsequent experiential search. Changing a cognitive 	representation itself can act as an important mode of adaptation, effectively resulting in the sequential allocation of attention to different facets of the environment. This virtue of shifting cognitive representation, however, may be offset by the loss of tacit knowledge associated with the prior cognition.},

  abstract={Entry timing benefits and costs typically vary with firms' capabilities. In this study, we empirically examine the entry timing implications of firms' intrinsic speed capabilities, which refer to the ability to execute investment projects faster than competitors. We hypothesize that firms with intrinsic speed capabilities face low preemption risks and, thus, can afford to wait longer for uncertainty resolution before deciding to enter new markets. This hypothesis is more applicable when investment is associated with higher levels of commitment and, thus, greater option value of waiting. A direct implication is that late entrants with intrinsic speed capabilities should have greater expected post-entry performance. We find support for these hypotheses in the Atlantic Basin liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry from 1996 to 2007.},

This option is exercised by further investment in product development, manufacturing and distribution. The process is described with reference to a comparative study of Japanese and U.S. venture capital firms. Similarities and differences between the two groups are reported, and a conceptual model of Japanese option strategy is formulated. The implications for our understanding of Japanese strategy and for strategic management theory are discussed.},

  year={2012},
  abstract={The value of real options has been discussed extensively?it helps explain managerial decisions in designing the rollout of bold initiatives in uncertain environments. However, few studies directly trace the impact of option usage on the performance of such entrepreneurial initiatives. Do all firms benefit from the flexibility that options confer? To answer this question, I collected detailed survey data on individual options designed into the implementation plans of entrepreneurial initiatives, focusing exclusively on options that were, eventually, in the money. The sample observations display significant variation in the degree to which flexibility benefit was realized from options, if at all. I find that this variance stems, in part, from heterogeneous organizational capability, regarding not only option creation but also option maintenance, exercise, and governance. These results imply that attainable benefit is highly firm specific. Holding valuable options does not predict performance of entrepreneurial initiatives, unless it is accompanied by active management of the option life cycle.},

  author={Klingebiel, Ronald and Adner, Ron},
  journal={Academy of Management Journal},

  pages={221--241},
  year={2015},
  abstract={We delineate three dimensions of resource allocation behavior that allow us to distinguish between real options logic and alternative resource allocation regimes: sequencing, low initial commitment, and reallocation. We then measure these in a product innovation context to test for the performance effect of real options logic vis-à-vis its alternatives. Sequencing, which distinguishes dynamic allocation regimes more generally, is associated with higher new product sales. Low initial commitment and reallocation do not show individual direct effects on new product sales. However, when assessed as a match, we find that the fit between low initial commitment and reallocation (yes?yes; no?no) increases performance significantly. After controlling for such fit as well as sequencing, we find no significant performance difference between real options logic and other regimes. Our findings imply that insufficient identification of real options logic picks up confounding effects, which may provide an explanation for the inconclusive results in prior studies of real options and performance. In addition to bounding the concept more precisely, we contribute to theory by situating real options logic within the broader set of allocation regimes conducive to innovation performance in uncertain, competitive markets.},

  abstract={This paper examines strategic investment games between two firms that compete for optimal entry in a project that generates uncertain revenue flows. Under asymmetry on both the sunk cost of investment and revenue flows of the two competing firms, we investigate the value of real investment options and strategic interaction of investment decisions. Compared to earlier models that only allow for asymmetry on sunk cost, our model demonstrates a richer set of strategic interactions of entry decisions. We provide a complete characterization of pre-emptive, dominant and simultaneous equilibriums by analyzing the relative value of leader?s and follower?s optimal investment thresholds. In a duopoly market with negative externalities, a firm may reduce loss of real options value by selecting appropriate pre-emptive entry. When one firm has a dominant advantage over its competitor, both the dominant firm and dominated firm enter at their respective leader?s and follower?s optimal thresholds. When the pre-emptive thresholds of both firms happen to coincide, the two firms enter simultaneously. Under positive externalities, firms do not compete to lead.},

The study reported in this paper tests this assertion by comparing the behavior and performance of three entrant categoriesÑnamely, pioneers, early followers and late entrants. A population ecology model is used to develop a set of hypotheses and these are tested on samples of start-up and adolescent businesses from the PIMS data base. The results show the three entrant categories to have significantly different strategic profiles and performance levels, with pioneers tending, on the average, to outperform later entrants.},

  pages={1257--1280},
  year={2008},
  abstract={The resource-based view of the firm suggests that the timing of market entry by a firm depends on its resources and capabilities, but several important questions remain. First, in a high-velocity market where capabilities change quickly, how does entry timing depend on the capabilities at varying points in time? Second, how much flexibility does a firm have in altering its capabilities to achieve desirable entry timing? To answer these questions, this study sets out to develop a dynamic, refined version of the resource-based view that parameterizes a firm by its time-varying capability relevance with respect to a focal market, and makes predictions on entry timing and future growth of capability relevance. The study develops a novel approach that uses the entrants' product portfolios to infer a potential entrant's capability relevance. The results based on a panel of potential entrants show that the initial and current capability relevance each affect entry timing alone, revealing the persistent effect of the initial condition. However, given the knowledge of the current capability relevance, the initial relevance has no effect on entry timing, suggesting that the initial relevance affects entry timing through its influence on the current relevance. Firms that are in an initially unfavorable position can still achieve early entry, provided that they improve their capability relevance over time.},

In the context of our study, this type of rhetoric associates the logics of firms' existing markets with the not-yet-legitimated logics of a newly emerging market. Our panel study shows that firms enter such markets faster when the associative rhetoric has higher (versus lower) volume, positive (versus negative) tenor, firms (versus journalists/analysts) as the source of information, and generalizations (versus specific cases) as the focus. We discuss the implications of our findings for institutional theory and market entry.},

We begin by posing questions about the basic definition of FMA and whether advantage should be measured in terms of profit, market share or business survival Ñ which often yield conflicting results. We then probe the related question of duration Ñ over what period of time must superior performance be sustained to constitute first mover advantage? Next we consider problems of identifying the starting date of a market and the basic question of how markets should be defined. Last, we consider a potentially important type of sample selection bias that has largely been overlooked. We conclude by assessing recent progress in entry order research.},

  author={Martignoni, Dirk and Menon, Anoop and Siggelkow, Nicolaj},
  journal={Strategic Management Journal},
  year={2016},
  publisher={Wiley Online Library},
  abstract = {Research summary: Mental models, reflecting interdependencies among managerial choice variables, are not always correctly specified. Mental models can be underspecified, missing interdependencies, or overspecified, containing nonexistent interdependencies. Using a simulation model, we find that under- and overspecification have opposite effects on exploration, and thereby, performance. The effects are also opposite, depending on whether a manager controls all choice variables. The mechanism underlying our results is a feedback loop: misspecified mental models influence managerial learning about the effectiveness of choices; this learning guides how the environment is explored, which in turn, affects which information will be generated for future learning. We explore implications of these results for strategic management and introduce the notion of ``cognitive fit'' between the mental model of the decision-maker and the strategic environment. Managerial summary: Managers often rely on mental models to guide their decision-making. These mental models, however, are often misspecified, that is, more or less complex than the situation managers are facing. Using a simulation model, we study the consequences of such misspecified mental models. We find that the performance implications of misspecified mental models crucially depend on whether the manager controls all choice variables. We identify situations in which simpler mental models are better than overly complex ones, and vice versa. }

We first outline a cognitive perspective for discussing competitive strategy, and then use this framework to analyse the particular case of the Scottish knitwear industry. We show how the structure of that industry both determines and is determined by managerial perceptions of the environment. We conclude by drawing out a few general implications of our framework for research and theory on competitive strategy.}

Despite significant progress made by each field separately towards our understanding of the theory and application of real options, opportunities exist for more cross-fertilization and the development of a more interdisciplinary knowledge base and research agenda. Furthermore, some new and relevant areas of study have deserve attention. In this paper, we take stock of the field of real options, focusing on the fundamental theoretical differences and remaining gaps between financial economics and strategy research, and we offer specific suggestions for future work to narrow this gap.}

	among firms, and that participants cluster competitors in subtle

	Decision makers' perceptions and cognitions are phenomena that can
	be expected to influence industry evolution. They are of research

	helps address concerns about previous strategic group research.},

This study revises conceptualizations of managerial and employee discourse in fostering and hampering the implementation of strategic change by broadening consideration of both the sources and the types of meanings used to ?construct? change.},

Abstract = {The economic, population ecology and strategic perspectives on firm survival are here complemented by viewing the same phenomenon from the viewpoint of technology evolution as well. The hypothesis tested is that the competitive environment of an industry, and therefore the survival of firms in it, is substantially affected by the evolution of the technology on which it is based. Survival analysis is applied to data from six industries. The results show that by explicitly including technology as a dynamic and strategic variable our understanding of firms' survival potential and success can be enhanced. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR },

  volume={57},
  number={10},
  pages={1737--1751},
  year={2011},
  abstract={We address the value of quick response production practices when selling to a forward-looking consumer population with uncertain, heterogeneous valuations for a product. Consumers have the option of purchasing the product early, before its value has been learned, or delaying the purchase decision until a time at which valuation uncertainty has been resolved. Whereas individual consumer valuations are uncertain ex ante, the market size is uncertain to the firm. The firm may either commit to a single production run at a low unit cost prior to learning demand, or commit to a quick response strategy that allows additional production after learning additional demand information. We find that the value of quick response is generally lower with strategic (forward-looking) customers than with nonstrategic (myopic) customers in this setting. Indeed, it is possible for a quick response strategy to decrease the profit of the firm, though whether this occurs depends on various characteristics of the market; specifically, we identify conditions under which quick response increases profit (when prices are increasing, when dissatisfied consumers can return the product at a cost to the firm) and conditions under which quick response may decrease profit (when prices are constant or when consumer returns are not allowed).},

  abstract={Research summary: This article provides a review of real options theory (ROT) in strategic management research. We review the fundamentals of ROT and provide a taxonomy of this research. By synthesizing and critiquing research on real options, we identify a number of important challenges as well as opportunities for ROT if it is to enhance its impact on strategic management and potentially develop into a theoretical pillar in the field. We examine how ROT can inform the key tensions that managers face between commitment versus flexibility as well as between competition versus cooperation, and we show how it can uniquely address the fundamental issues in strategy. We conclude with suggestions on future research directions that could enhance and unify the thus-far distinct main approaches to real options research.
Managerial summary: Real options theory (ROT) applies the heuristics and valuation models originally designed for financial securities to the domain of corporate investment decisions (e.g., joint ventures [JVs], foreign direct investment, research and development [R&D], etc.) and strategic decision making under uncertainty. This article provides a synthesis of this body of research in strategic management and related disciplines. We suggest how ROT can address fundamental issues of strategy, including the dilemmas managers face between commitment versus flexibility as well as between competition versus cooperation. We discuss how three distinct approaches to real options analysis can complement each other, and we identify some of the main challenges and opportunities for ROT to become a theoretical pillar in strategy. },

  abstract = {There is empirical evidence that established firms often have difficulty adapting to radical technological change. Although prior work in the evolutionary tradition emphasizes the inertial forces associated with the local nature of learning processes, little theoretical attention has been devoted in this tradition to understanding how managerial cognition affects the adaptive intelligence of organizations. Through an in-depth case study of the response of the Polaroid Corporation to the ongoing shift from analog to digital imaging, we expand upon this work by examining the relationship between managers' understanding of the world and the accumulation of organizational capabilities. The Polaroid story clearly illustrates the importance of managerial cognitive representations in directing search processes in a new learning environment, the evolutionary trajectory of organizational capabilities, and ultimately processes of organizational adaptation.}

@article{Weaver.10,
	Abstract = {Electromechanical products and systems are often designed to transform or reconfigure between two or more states. Each state is customized to fulfill a specific set of functions, and the transformation between these multiple states allows for greater functionality and the elimination of many trade-offs between conflicting needs. Empirical examination of existing transforming systems and their similarities has led to a foundational transformation design theory, with meta-analogies and guidelines that explain how transformation processes occur, when they are useful, and how the designer can ensure their maxi- mum benefit. The foundation of these principles and guidelines forms a meta-analogical framework for designing transformers and transformational systems. This paper presents a history of the development of transformational design theory, including the relationship of the research to case-based reasoning in other fields. Ideation methods are presented that specifically exploit the meta-analogies, i.e., categories of transformers. An example design problem is considered to illustrate the potential utility of this design-by-analogy approach.},

  abstract={Entry decisionsÑoften critical to firm survival and growth, market evolution, and industry profit- abilityÑhave been the subject of inquiry for decades. In particular, the timing of entry decisions, drawing primarily on the first-mover advantage (FMA) perspective, has emerged as a prominent area of study. While previous research confirms that entry timing is critical, a large number of contingencies create conceptual and methodological complexities that undermine the formation of a rigorous theory of entry timing. In this article, we review and synthesize management and market- ing research on entry timing published in top-tier outlets from 1989 through 2013Ñthe 25-year period that followed the publication of Lieberman and MontgomeryÕs seminal article on FMA. Distilling key lessons from this literature, our review tries to establish a foundational understanding of the conditions, methods, implications, and strategies of entry timing so that research might be reinvigorated in this domain. Our article concludes by offering a conceptual model of entry based on the lessons gleaned from the articles that we reviewed.},
