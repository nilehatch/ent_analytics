In the previous chapter, we saw that profit becomes conditional under rivalry.

Now we examine a special case.

Two firms.
Identical products.
Customers care only about price.

No differentiation.
No loyalty.
No switching friction.

What happens to profit?



## The Undifferentiated Case

Suppose two firms sell the same product at the same cost.

If one firm sets a higher price, customers switch immediately.

If one firm sets a lower price, it captures the entire market.

If both firms charge the same price, they split demand.

Under these conditions, pricing becomes a race downward.

If your rival prices at $P$, you can take the whole market by pricing slightly below $P$.

Your rival can respond the same way.

Undercutting continues until price equals marginal (variable) cost.

At that point:

$$ \mathsf{P = c}$$

Contribution margin disappears.

Profit becomes:

$$
\mathsf{\pi = (P - c)Q - f = -f}
$$

Fixed cost cannot be recovered.

## Structural Collapse

This is not bad management.
It is not poor execution.
It is not lack of marketing.

It is structure.

If products are identical and customers respond only to price, economic profit collapses.

Even if demand is strong.
Even if scale is large.
Even if both firms are competent.

Contribution margin is competed away.

## Implication for Feasibility

Return to the feasibility question:

> Is this worth doing?

If you enter an undifferentiated market without cost advantage, the answer is no.

Your earlier profit curve assumed:
- Stable demand
- A chosen price
- A recoverable margin

In undifferentiated competition, margin cannot survive.

Feasibility must be evaluated at the price that survives rivalry.

And in this structure, that price equals cost.

## The Only Escapes

There are only two structural ways out:

1. Lower cost than rivals.
2. Differentiate so customers do not switch purely on price.

Everything else is storytelling.

Branding without differentiation.
Hope without insulation.
Marketing without structural shift.

None of it restores margin in a pure price war.

## The Decision Lens

Before entering a market, ask:

- Are we undifferentiated?
- Are we competing primarily on price?
- Do we have a structural cost advantage?

If the answer is no to all three, profit will not survive.

This is not pessimism.

It is disciplined pre-revenue reasoning.

Some markets eliminate profit by design.

Your job is to recognize them before committing fixed cost.
