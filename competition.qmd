Competition is fundamentally about contending with rivals to capture and retain customers. This contest is not merely a battle for market share; it is a critical determinant of a company’s overall performance and long-term viability. The demand a business creates with its product or service defines its ability to attract and keep customers.

At its core, competition in business is a zero-sum game for customers—every customer won by one firm is a loss for another. However, the real battleground is profitability. Successful firms don’t just capture customers; they find ways to keep them while maximizing profit. 

To understand competition effectively, we must go beyond simple textbook models. Real-world firms rarely operate in pure monopoly or perfect competition. Instead, most businesses compete in an oligopoly, where a few firms shape the market and respond strategically to each other. This chapter explores what that means for entrepreneurs and why Bertrand competition—where firms compete on price—is the most relevant model for startups and growth-stage companies.

## Competitive Extremes: Monopoly vs. Perfect Competition

### Entrepreneurs Dream of Monopoly, but It Rarely Lasts  

A monopoly is the ideal scenario for a business: one firm controls the market, sets its own prices, and faces no direct competition. Peter @thiel14 famously encourages entrepreneurs to seek monopolistic positions, using innovation, branding, and market dominance to insulate themselves from competition.

However, true monopolies are exceedingly rare. Even when firms create something new, competitors follow. 

- Google may dominate search with over 90 percent market share worldwide, but it still has competitors like Bing and DuckDuckGo. 
- Tesla once had a near monopoly Tesla once had a monopoly on the EV market, but competitors quickly emerged. By 2024, Tesla’s U.S. market share dropped below 60% as legacy automakers introduced their own EV models. 

Even when you create a new market, competition will follow.

For most startups, a lasting monopoly is a pipe dream. The real challenge is navigating competition in oligopolistic markets, where rivals react to every move.

### Entrepreneurs in Perfect Competition Are Living a Nightmare  

At the other extreme, perfect competition describes markets with many small firms selling identical products—think of small farmers selling wheat or corn. In this setting, no firm has pricing power, and competition between firms drives profits to their minimum.  

Many Amazon E-commerce third-party sellers offer the exact same products as their rivals and undercut each other on price, leading to razor-thin margins.  As long as they continue to sell the same things as other sellers, there is no way to grow margins and profit.

For an entrepreneur, perfect competition is a death trap. If you enter a market where everyone sells the same thing at the same price, you have no control over your business. While it’s crucial to understand the dynamics of perfect competition, as an entrepreneur, steering clear of such markets is advisable.

### Alert Entrepreneurs Compete in the Reality of Oligopoly  

Most entrepreneurs find themselves in oligopoly markets, where a small number of firms dominate and strategic interactions matter. Unlike perfect competition, businesses in an oligopoly can influence prices, differentiate products, and shape consumer choices.[^2]

[^2]: There are many forms of oligopoly competition where firms compete on different variables such as quantity, price, timing, and product differentiation. We will not consider the other forms of oligopoly here because Bertrand oligopoly is most relevant to entrepreneurship. For a broader perspective on the types of oligopolistic competition, see the supplementary chapters on Cournot oligopoly, Stackelberg Oligopoly, and collusion.

- Apple may appear to behave as a monopoly, charging \$1,200 for an iPhone while rivals like Samsung and Google offer similar specs for less. But customers have choices, and Apple continuously innovates to differentiate the iPhone experience to justify its prices compared to rivals. Its differentiation—brand prestige, ecosystem lock-in, and design—gives it pricing power, but competition is always lurking.
- Many luxury brands create the illusion of monopoly, but they still compete against alternatives (e.g., Omega vs. Rolex, Lamborghini vs. Ferrari).

Oligopoly is the competitive reality for startups. Even if you begin with a new, innovative product, competitors will emerge. Success depends on understanding how to compete strategically, whether through pricing, differentiation, branding, or innovation.

## Monopolistic Competition: The Comforting Illusion  

Many businesses behave as if they are monopolists, setting prices and strategies without paying much attention to competitors. This mindset is encouraged by monopolistic competition, an economic framework where firms assume they have pricing power due to product differentiation.

However, competition still exists and matters. Even if a business thinks it has a monopoly, customers are aware of alternatives, and rivals will react. 

In the previous book part on **Profit**, we explored demand, revenue, costs, and break-even analysis—implicitly assuming monopoly conditions. That assumption holds in cases where:  
1. A firm has created a temporary monopoly through innovation or branding.  
2. Customers perceive a product as unique enough to justify higher prices.  
3. Competitors are too weak or inattentive to respond effectively.  

But this illusion is short-lived. Most entrepreneurs quickly find themselves in an oligopoly, where competitors fight for market share, and pricing power is limited. 

**The Takeaway:** Entrepreneurs should use monopolistic competition thinking as a tool for differentiation, not as an excuse to ignore competition. The more a firm assumes it has monopoly power, the more vulnerable it is to being blindsided by real competitors.

## The Realities of Competing on Price

### Avoid the Quicksand of Price Competition

Successful companies continuously strategize to captivate their target customers. One common approach is enhancing product value through innovation and effective branding. However, a more direct and often perilous route is through *price competition*---lowering prices to divert customers from competitors. This method, while immediately impactful, can trigger a chain reaction of price matching or undercutting by competitors, culminating in a harmful price war. The more they compete, the further they sink into price wars. Such wars often result in selling similar quantities but at continually decreasing prices, eroding profits for all involved.

### The Inevitability of Competing on Price

Despite the evident risks of price competition, it's crucial to acknowledge a fundamental truth: all firms, in one way or another, compete on price. The pricing decisions made by businesses significantly influence customer purchasing choices, thus determining the demand for their products. Price considerations remain paramount even when a company's focus is on non-price factors like product features or brand allure. The challenge lies in strategically setting prices that optimize profit without igniting a price war.

### Extend Strategic Focus to Pricing and Beyond

Our goal is to master the art of competing effectively while not solely relying on price. This requires a keen understanding of oligopoly markets, particularly in contexts where the temptation to engage in price battles is strongest. We delve into the concept of *undifferentiated Bertrand oligopoly*, where the allure and risks of pure price competition loom large, and contrast it with *differentiated Bertrand oligopoly*. In the latter, product differentiation plays a pivotal role, offering avenues to sidestep a battle centered only on price.

### Diverse Customers Prefer Diverse Products over Lower Prices

The idea that a race to the lowest price benefits customers seems appealing, especially in markets with undifferentiated products. It suggests a scenario where everyone gets exactly what they want at the lowest possible price. However, this notion overlooks a critical aspect of consumer behavior: heterogeneity in customer preferences. Customers often seek varied products that cater specifically to their unique needs. In such a diverse marketplace, the lowest price for a one-size-fits-all product is rarely the most attractive option. This is true even in segments with limited incomes, where the demand for variety and specificity remains robust. Therefore, a market thriving on serving customer diversity often trumps one racing to the bottom in pricing, especially in meeting the nuanced needs of a varied customer base.

## Bertrand Competition Is Most Relevant for Entrepreneurs

The most relevant form of competition for entrepreneurs is Bertrand competition, where firms compete on price. All of our analytics of competition will be built on two forms of price-setting oligopoly:

### Undifferentiated Bertrand: The Danger of Pure Price Wars  
- When products are identical, price wars are unavoidable.  
- Profits are driven to zero as firms undercut each other.  
- This is not a viable strategy for startups.  

### Differentiated Bertrand: The Strategy of Smart Startups  
- Differentiation creates pricing power.  
- Entrepreneurs should focus on branding, product features, and loyalty programs.  
- Instead of competing purely on price, create customer preference for your product.  

**The Key Insight:** Startups must find a way to avoid pure price competition or differentiate to justify higher prices.

## Conclusion: Winning the Competitive Game  

- Competition is inevitable, but smart entrepreneurs shape how they compete.  
- Avoid perfect competition, build differentiation, and be strategic about pricing.  
- The next chapters will explore undifferentiated Bertrand competition where price wars dominate and differentiated Bertrand competition where branding and strategy win.  


<!-- from the old chapter reading quiz

How do customer preferences influence pricing and price competition?
  Lowering prices is the most effective way to attract all customer segments. 
  Price competition leads to higher profits by increasing market demand. 
Correct Answer
  Heterogeneity in customer preferences makes the lowest price not always the most desirable option. 
  Product innovation and branding are less important than price competition. 
  Engaging in price wars is the most sustainable strategy for long-term growth. 
  All firms should focus solely on price to outcompete rivals. 
General answer comments
While competing on price is an unavoidable aspect of business, it should not be the sole focus of a company’s strategy. It emphasizes that the lure of lowering prices can lead to detrimental price wars, where similar quantities are sold but at continually decreasing prices, ultimately eroding profits. Furthermore, it points out the importance of recognizing customer heterogeneity - customers have diverse preferences and often value product variety and specificity over the lowest price. This understanding underlines why a strategy focused solely on price reduction is not always the most attractive or effective in meeting the varied needs of a customer base.

What is the primary outcome when firms engage in a price war in an undifferentiated Bertrand Oligopoly?
  Firms achieve higher profits due to increased market share. 
  The market price stabilizes at a level above the cost of production. 
  Only the highest-cost competitor remaining in the market earns zero profit when there are different costs and capacity constraints. 
  Price wars lead to significant product innovation. 
  Firms develop stronger brand loyalty among customers. 
Correct Answer
  Firms end up earning zero economic profit as prices fall to the level of costs. 
General answer comments
In an undifferentiated Bertrand Oligopoly, firms often engage in price wars, continuously undercutting each other's prices. This process ultimately leads to an equilibrium where prices fall to the level of the firms' production costs. At this point, further price reductions would result in losses, so firms have no incentive to change their pricing strategy. The consequence is that all competing firms earn zero economic profit, which means they cover their costs and compensate for the risk and effort, but do not generate surplus profits.

Low-price guarantees
  protect customers from price gouging competitors. 
Correct Answer
  protect competitors from undercutting each others' prices. 
  ensure that markets are efficient in delivering what customers want. 
  are a hassle free way for customers to manage their budgets. 
General answer comments
if a firm has a low-price guarantee in place, if its rival undercuts its price, its customers do not go to the rival but rather come to the firm and ask for the guarantee to be fulfilled. Since the rival gets no additional quantity but suffers a loss in price, the rival has no incentive to undercut price and the firms maintain price above cost in equilibrium. This deterrent to price cutting would probably surprise many customers who think the guarantee is a protection device offered by a caring company rather than a mechanism to keep prices high.

What differentiates a market operating under Differentiated Bertrand Competition from one under Undifferentiated Bertrand Competition?
Correct Answer
  Products in Differentiated Bertrand are distinct, influencing customer preferences and choices. 
  In Differentiated Bertrand, products are identical across different firms. 
  Firms in Differentiated Bertrand do not compete on price. 
  Differentiated Bertrand markets have no entry barriers. 
  In Differentiated Bertrand, firms cannot influence market equilibrium. 
General answer comments
Differentiated Bertrand Competition is characterized by the presence of unique product characteristics across different firms. Unlike in Undifferentiated Bertrand Competition, where products are seen as identical by customers, Differentiated Bertrand markets have products that are distinct in the eyes of consumers. This differentiation allows firms to have some degree of pricing power and lessens the intensity of price competition, as customers may show loyalty or preference for specific product attributes.

How do firms in a Differentiated Bertrand market reach equilibrium pricing?
  Firms set prices based on costs alone, ignoring competitor pricing. 
  Equilibrium is achieved through government regulation of prices. 
  The essence of competition in business is to navigate between extremes of monopoly and perfect competition. 
  Firms reach equilibrium by engaging in non-stop price wars. 
  Equilibrium is reached when all firms offer their products for free. 
Correct Answer
  Equilibrium pricing is determined through the intersection of each firm’s reaction function to competitor pricing. 
General answer comments
In a Differentiated Bertrand market, each firm considers its competitor's pricing when determining its own optimal price. This mutual dependency is captured in what are known as reaction functions. The reaction function of each firm shows how it should adjust its prices in response to the pricing of its competitors. The point where these reaction functions intersect represents the optimal pricing for both firms, where neither has an incentive to deviate from their chosen price. This intersection point is where the Bertrand-Nash equilibrium is established, ensuring that both firms can simultaneously choose their best responses in terms of pricing.
